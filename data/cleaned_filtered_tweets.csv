Annes role is launch site engineering Dont think she has anything against media just not her role
Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla That will hopefully change over time
Guaranteeing the worlds best resale value in industry is unprecedented backed up my other assets Why isnt that good
Chris is great Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills who fully understood the system
Yes this does put an indirect floor on resale value Should help all owners
Yeah that is super tricky Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform
yes that has been the goal from the beginning
We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy Extremely tough
Side boosters fall short center core goes too far Florida is heavily populated Landing permission tricky

Exactly Better to tax known bad thing incent desired outcome instead of subsidizing particular solution paths Let market decide

Perhaps I am in favor of fair simple taxes that are neutral on most things incent good disincent bad
Yes am arguing against subsidies in favor of a tax on the end bad created Market will then achieve best solution
If consumption is low then the tax is proportionately low We should prob not have tax on basic foods critical meds

Awesome We really need to promote that fact in the US A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt
The collective wisdom of the market is usually not always better than the smartest govt regulator

Aiming to launch this weekend hopefully land on our droneship Ship landings needed for high velocity missions SpaceX Jan Fullduration static fire complete at our California pad Preliminary data looks good in advance of Jason launch
Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday SpaceX Jan The Falcon has landed New footage recap of our recent launch landing
Well at least the pieces were bigger this time Wont be last RUD but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing
Falcon lands on droneship but the lockout collet doesnt latch on one the four legs causing it
My best guess for landing success rate so still a few more RUDs to go then hopefully improving to in
Definitely harder to land on a ship Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land much smaller target area thats also translating rotating
Conducted holddown firing of returned Falcon rocket Data looks good overall but engine showed thrust fluctuations
However that was not what prevented it being good Touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didnt latch so it tipped over after landing
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions Altitude distance dont mean much for orbit All about speed
Maybe some debris ingestion Engine data looks ok Will borescope tonight This is one of the outer engines
If speed at stage separation kmhr With a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to kmh
Actually didnt get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed
I didnt take anyones car never would Car was actually allocated to engineering test not by me inadvertently sold
Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage but payload would be greatly reduced

Model orders by end of Sat
And of course it will have more cowbells
Model will be RWD with dual motor AWD optional Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain
In general product comments suggestions criticisms are always welcome
Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA Thanks for the suggestions Btw we really will have more cow bells
A Model order gives you priority in your geography so even tho total count is high ordering early will make a big difference locally
Wait until you see the real steering controls system for the It feels like a spaceship
It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
We are working on an exact date but Tesla will be in India before production starts
They can Will be great for road trips camping
They will We spent a lot of time on those
thats not the real steering system

Matte black was surprisingly popular Probably makes sense to bring it to production
torque is shifted between front rear motors every secs Traction control is way better than a normal AWD Digital vs analog
Edge contour refinement are ongoing Even 1mm matters
No but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve longterm regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity
yes but production AWD will be a lot faster
Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non XS customers to receive the credit
Superchargers service centers will cover all of Italy later this year

Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof crosscar support beam A bike will still fit no problem
Wont happen Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues
Yes if the trend continues before
Will cover whole country hopefully this year
wont be a hatchback but we should be able to increase the opening width height
you can do that now with S X Will be same for

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 1M lbf at liftoff twice any rocket currently flying Its a beast
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 71M lbf later this year It is capable of 9M lbf in flight
Max performance numbers are for expendable launches Subtract to for reusable booster payload
F9 LEO payload on capabilities page correct figure on main page should be kg
Historical precedent Mars vehicle will be metric
turns out it doesnt need securing
Zuck doesnt yet have a deep tech understanding of AI I spend hours every week being educated by worlds best researchers
for almost everything for heat shields a few other items
No cross feed It would help performance but is not needed for these numbers
JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot fast mission so will land on the droneship Next land landing in a few months
No physical changes to the engine This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests It is just tougher than we thought
Basically current but higher throttle setting Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin

Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines Probably get there end of year
Looks like thrust was low on of landing engines High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe accordion the engines

Reading the source material is better than reading other peoples opinions about the source material Garrett DAmore Jan Not a trump lover by any means but after reading the language of the order it looks far less bad than portrayed by left
Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI futureoflifeorg AI Principles Future of Life Institute
Yes the order is still bad but it is always important to read the source material
I agree with creating great jobs restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products anything that makes the future exciting
Headline article is misleading I said it wont be retracted ie withdrawn by Pres It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means
Yes I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity
Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President not fewer How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good

Norway is great on all levels Love Norway
Yes but Model is the overwhelming priority
Me too I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon
I love Canada Im half Canadian My Mom was born in Regina My grandfather her Dad was American born in Minnesota
People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible Blind hate is never the right answer
Yeah it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars tone is lost in text
Youre right Politics is a nowin situation Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is
I dont know what make you think thats a rocket Its completely covered in a tarpaulin

Gravimetric energy density of batteries achieving a high cell mass fraction
True Me being one of them
Really Ok I will work harder on thinking first tweeting second Sorry for anything thoughtless
Also Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you dont use it improve performance further
Also good There are several that are on par with US Just dont think any are better People confuse laws with courts
Motor Trend could only achieve sec when they tested the Porsche
Almost there We are just being very careful with the rollout
Not perfect cd be better but 10th out of countries with only a diff to 1st place means its essentially on par
I agree great country Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit Ive heard it is incredibly beautiful
Those countries have strong justice systems but Id put them roughly on par with US That rating system conflates many factors
Isnt that basically like having a jury of peers That is a default option in the US
Actually I think its kinda cool

Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo launch pad tomorrow morning webcast
Btw likely to be fine closed loop TVC wd overcome error but that chance isnt worth rolling the dice Better to wait a day
Looks like we are go for launch Added an abort trigger at T secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system
Ok what are some good ones Will have to meter these out Hopefully kids cant die from groaning too much
If this is the only issue flight would be fine but need to make sure that it isnt symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
Yeah awesome achievement by ISRO Very impressive
Its much easier to do the CGI that way
System was green for launch I called it off
Youre right I cant hide any more I am Irony Man
Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
They are often right but in this case we have already retired so much RD risk on Dragon that I feel very confident of
they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published I said the same thing a week already
Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side RP kerosene turbopump so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
You may come to regret that request
Not obviously related to the very tiny helium leak but also not out of the question
Yes but only deep in solid rock where the walls are selfsupporting concrete reinforcements arguably arent needed
Yeah exactly So that makes it cool right

This is not true TM works for a lot of people thats great but Ive maybe done it or times ever
I didnt pose for it hopefully thats obvious or want me on cover Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
Thank you for the lovely letter That sounds like a great idea Well do it Steven Loveday Mar Elon my daughter wrote you a letter for a school project She mailed it to Tesla but I figured Id paste here Thank you
Tesla will get the system installed working days from contract signature or it is free That serious enough for you

Youre most welcome Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity Renewables storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC Malcolm Turnbull Mar Thanks for a great in depth discussion today about energy storage its role in delivering affordable reliable electricity
Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan especially
Ironically direct current is the right approach today even though alternating was right in the past Solar power electronics both DC
Can only happen with your support working closely with key govt utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches
Just spoke with Premier of South Australia Very impressed Govt is clearly committed to a smart quick solution
High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances Good explanation at enmwikipediaorg Highvoltage direct current Wikipedia
I love Wikipedia Just gets better over time
Answer is complex for electric motors We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter which kinda digitizes DC power
Sure Just check out my prior tweet on pricing kWh at pack level Website will be updated soon so there is complete transparency
Looking forward to it I know its cliche but LotR is my favorite book ever Want to see the set take my kids on tour of greater NZ
Its been a bear to get done but prob days or so depending on full speed autosteer test results
is a great car but definitely Model S
First drive of a release candidate version of Model 8M views
Model was going to be called Model E for obvious dumb humor reasons but Ford sued to block it so now it is S3X Totally different
Where are the aliens inversecom Drake Equation Revision Hugely Ups Odds Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life Exists A new study revises the famous Drake equation gives optimists some more support
Am noticing that many people think Model is the next version of a Tesla like iPhone vs This is not true
Model is just a smaller more affordable version of Model S w less range power fewer features Model S has more advanced technology
Just because Im building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesnt mean Im an alien
Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years Kinda have to
The more autonomous a car is the less dash info you need How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi
Because I was a dumb idiot didnt realize at the time that it would cause confusion
If fate is on our side it will be amazing Will talk about that in detail next week
Yup machine arrives next month we start digging the tunnel
How about the video we just took of the first Model release candidate drive
Damn straight we do Coming with next week
Yes Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster which is a few years away
Should be summer next year Sorry really wish we could get RHD done sooner We truly are working as fast as we can
Sorta Model is like a BMW series or Audi A4 Model S is like BMW series but much faster more storage space Autopilot
Let me just go fetch my magic wand
Looking forward to playing the game with my kids
All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of selfdriving as software improves
Yes but not until next year
The Model S produced today is arguably version Let me put it this way it is the car I will keep driving even after Model arrives
The shorter wheelbase only allows for a kWh pack in Model at current cellmodule energy densities
The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one Im being optimistic
Yeah probably a year from now S will still win on acceleration though due to having more space for a larger battery
No we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule RWD only for early production just like Model S
Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice Lots of new tech in the design production process though
Only Model S will have the seven seater option more cargo space plus higher range acceleration two screens vs one auto extend handles
First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it which is probably in to months
Yes Hardware already on all production S X cars
Probably Either that simulation great filter or they are very very subtle
We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster You would get first in Norway
Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space Next goal is reflight within hours

Its just a helicopter in helicopters clothing

Yeah control algorithm is safe but unpleasant New one is even safer but super smooth
HW2 HW1 doesnt have enough sensors computing power

Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub asis That design cant actually convert from car to sub Have a new design in mind that does
Model Model X Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability Its just a matter of refining the vision control software
We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint Just need to add in the billing software
Theres just no way Hundreds of parts most of wiring harness would have to be replaced Would cost more to retrofit than trading in
All Model S X cars will have an auto raise lower function for the steering wheel in a few months
Will shut that down The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends it is limited to people
You can easily turn it off in the car via settings but that would beg the question of why you turned it off

Getting closer to fairing recovery reuse Had some problems with the steerable parachute Should have it sorted out by end of year
They will but the hydraulic system is closed loop so no fluid lost They do need more power energy but rocket has plenty of that
Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum but more control authority can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard Reviewing telemetry
No but shielding got fragged every flight More control authority is for Falcon Heavy but also enables Falcon to land in heavier winds
They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack peak heating is the cube of speed so a Mach reentry is 8X Mach Intense
We used to have a lame open loop hydraulic system but that was upgraded to closed about years ago
More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
True but thats a minor factor for rockets

For sure First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion Will start NYDC in parallel Then prob LASF a TX loop
City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from OHare to downtown Theyve been great
Adding Boston Providence would be the natural extension of the line
An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground be way faster so I think it is he right way to go

We are going to move all info settings to the cloud aka server so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you

The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire train local team as fast as possible
Assume the worst Now I need to get back to work
Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall only taxes shipping costs vary so something is messed up here Ive asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums
It would need to refill to return but it could get to Jupiter with low payload
There is only one config being built right now so the only question is What color Dont need a configurator for that
Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve Late Oct is possible but not certain Literally every day makes a big difference

Obviously a flamethrower is a super terrible idea Definitely dont buy one
But wait theres more the flamethrower is sentient its safe word is cryptocurrency it comes with a free blockchain

Say hello to my little friend
Youd need millions of zombies for a socalled apocalypse anyway Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many
So hard to keep future product releases secret
ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than ft is Aok Our design is max fun for least danger Id be way more scared of a steak knife
For sure it keeps you warm at the same time
Hmm portal gun Now that would be interesting
Good thing you didnt ask about the Freezegun
Apparently some customs agencies are saying they wont allow shipment of anything called a Flamethrower To solve this we are renaming it Not a Flamethrower
This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didnt hurt the droneship but amazingly it has survived We will try to tow it back to shore
All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher

Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights Fix is pretty obvious
The performance numbers in this database are not accurate In process of being fixed Even if they were a fully expendable Falcon Heavy which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy is 150M compared to over 400M for Delta IV Heavy
Both exhaust velocity Isp mass ratio drive the rocket equation Also thrustmass matters a lot for Oberth effect Delta upper stage Isp is good but mass ratio thrust are not
East to support high flight rates for F9 dual ocean landings for FH side boosters
Maybe that plan works out but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before
Found the source of the problem The NASA database has the Falcon Block performance Version currently in production set to fly in a few months is Block SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers
Side boosters landing on droneships center expended is only performance penalty vs fully expended Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9 so around 95M
Under consideration Weve already stretched the upper stage once Easiest part of the rocket to change Fairing flying soon also has a slightly larger diameter Could make fairing much longer if need be will if BFR takes longer than expected
That was three years ago before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on so their cost is now 600M for missions contracted for launch after Nutty high
Im sure its parked around here somewhere

I dont get the little ship thing You cant show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat What if there are Martians It would be so embarrassing
Missed by a few hundred meters but fairing landed intact in water Should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down descent
High altitude wind shear data shows a probable load exceedance Small but better to be paranoid Postponing launch to tomorrow assuming winds are better then
Can someone please do that I would def go
If you love drones above your house youll really love vast numbers of cars flying over your head that are times bigger noisier blow away anything that isnt nailed down when they land
This was an older version booster so no recovery attempted

Do you think the US China should have equal fair rules for cars Meaning same import duties ownership constraints other factors
Also no US auto company is allowed to own even of their own factory in China but there are five Chinaowned EV auto companies in the US
For example an American car going to China pays import duty but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays a tenfold difference
I guess you could say its a mph underground autonomous electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels lifts So yes a bus
We raised this with the prior administration nothing happened Just want a fair outcome ideally where tariffsrules are equally moderate Nothing more Hope this does not seem unreasonable
I am against import duties in general but the current rules make things very difficult Its like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes
Literally if you type jazz hands iOS shows this emoji
To be clear I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely China has already shown a willingness to open their markets I believe they will do the right thing

I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build delivery Customer happiness safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter
First time Ive seen either One on the left looks official Will be gone soon

Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article track the credibility score over time of each journalist editor publication Thinking of calling it Pravda
For some reason this is the best Ive felt in a while Hope youre feeling good too
My point exactly Rocky May He never said we didnt Quite the contrary His point is that a free society needs a free credible press The responsibility of The Fourth Estate can never be fulfilled by a press that the people have lost confidence in
If youre in media dont want Pravda to exist write an article telling your readers to vote against it
Create a media credibility rating site that also flags propaganda botnets Yes this would be good No media are awesome votes Final results
Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right I do actually own but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News
Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score the journalists editors publications will It is how they define themselves

Hi Kara Im open to it Right now Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory so it depends on how things are going next week
Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
Thank you I thought it was so obvious
Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union UAW abandoned this factory Tesla arrived gave people back their jobs They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ let alone enough sigs for a vote
Ahem you have nano in your bio That is synonymous with bs
We dont The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised It is untrue
It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla millions more auto deaths but somehow get less coverage We are not perfect but were doing our best to make clean energy real be a good company
Why are certain journalists editors especially so concerned about the public rating their credibility All they do all day is rate ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt
An exception that proves the rule
Yes because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world products that havent been unveiled yet You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches
Thats why editors are included too
I just made that up because the Ides of March sounded good
But consider it real We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year so March is about right
Have a confirmed real name identity section an unconfirmed identity section Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets
I did to any who asked
Maybe after you get your Model we can talk about what you like what needs to be improved
Exactly The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public
Exactly UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company
That was obvious from a mile away I tried to use their product it didnt work Not exactly a genius move by WSJ but they were brave enough to say it
At risk of stating the extremely obvious I am against threats of violence abusive epithets in any forum Please do not use them in my name or at all

Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up removing context A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people my response was that powerful people also own media Thus if you discount polls you should also discount media

Sadly it had better critical analysis than most noncult media
Also firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model started rolling out yesterday Should improve braking distance by ft for repeated heavy braking events Thanks for excellent critical feedback
Youre welcome to come by SpaceX but please stop assuming Im against all journalists This is not true Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media
This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist What a hypocrite Erielle Davidson May Worth noting that the journalist harassed by Musk bros had previously made jokes about Elon Musks genitalia on Twitter Good grief This place

Youre right These guys can buzzkill themselves pun intended Signing off
No but dual motors mean increased regen braking will ride tire traction limit You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack have the sticky tires
Great book Read it when it came out
Nano is a unit of measure not a field imo Wouldve been sexist not to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman
Gaiman did you actually read my tweets I didnt set anyone on anyone A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was antiscience I said that was false Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations Thats messed up
Had a great time with my kids
Yes AWD P first then AWD Production costs are always high when line first gets going so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins As production efficiency rises we can make lower cost versions not lose money

All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8 software To report a bug or ask for a feature press voice button say bug report followed by issue description MacTechGenius May Sounds good Even though I have an early the build quality is great Can we expect any of these features in a future update my Tesla wishlist
Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
The results speak for themselves Singapore is a very prosperous city yet has very few electric cars
Model Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so Its a really great car Not saying that lightly Test drive is a mindwarp Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model cars in stores within to weeks
We have about projects underway in Puerto Rico
Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so Many fit this description but Consumer Reports is always fair accurate in their criticism
Model S X also have an acid gas filter an alkaline gas filter a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode We should prob tell people about this more Filters are giant so too big to fit in Model

Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun Solar energy is more than most people realize 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity which is a strategic vulnerability
That sounds like a fun adventure
Youre most welcome More to come in this regard
Usually they dont even realize it All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks That is the true nature of the corruption It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks but they are often manipulated into doing so
Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow so we prob wont offer Model leases for to months Loan financing is a better deal anyway as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value but Teslas have always had strong residual value
Pneumatic means propelled by air Opposite of Hyperloop
You should get an invite to configure in next few days
You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel it looks pretty cool We could offer that as an option at purchase
Try adjusting tire pressure Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate

Talked with Tesla team Looks like we can do the aluminum Model pedal covers slightly different from S Turning on production for Model Performance version
Congratulations Good move by Please use Matts Twitter pic Essence of a good editor
No plans for aluminum pedals Adds too much production complexity Model will def have summon which will get way more advanced for S X w HW2 Autopilot all Model cars
We are ramping production as fast as possible Wait should be closer to months though not years
No way mins is enough for abs I mean come on mins is obv right
Yeah actually closer to Skylab but with larger inner diameter
Were building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast excellent outcome

At Zip2 I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps calculating point to point directions anywhere in US first ever company to do so as well as white pages business listings w reviews an early Yelp Also wrote V1 of classifieds autotrading real estate apps

Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional city papers online for the first time made major functionality advancements to the NY Times Boston Globe KnightRidder websites NYT KR Hearst were all major investors in Zip2
You have my word Marques Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world For those who love to drive there is no finer car in history we dont think there will be another
We use less than cobalt in our batteries will use none in next gen
Thanks Have heard universally great things about your podcasts
Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far no exceptions thus transferring the halo crown effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric
Thats quite a blast from the past After my Zip2 experience w patents I felt that patents particularly software inhibited innovation instead of fostering it I aspired to file zero patents after that In we opensourced all Tesla patents teslacom All Our Patent Are Belong To You Yesterday there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters That is no longer the case They have been removed in the spirit of the open source movement for the
Each flamethrower comes with a stateoftheart The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter
Using the config you describe plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV when car power draw drops below max pack power output makes sense But we are going to go a lot further
Note gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump which is most of the time
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this Sounds like a good idea Will do so after Model production reaches week steady
We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires but The Boring Company is donating
Yes interface will change with Version software
Some very very tough calls Had to let go of good people but I think they will find new jobs quickly
In early 90s I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU CDROM to act in parallel so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly Required C assembly direct flipping of CPU registers That companys name was Rocket Science Fate loves irony
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution A complicated one is relatively easy
Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now fully fixed in August update as part of our longawaited Tesla Version To date Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety With V9 we will begin to enable full selfdriving features
Yes Hopefully Im not tempting fate too much with that date It was meant as a joke but is about the right actual timing
Sigh This is crux of matter cant make system too annoying or people wont use it negatively affecting safety but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially
Exactly Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery but power output is insane The composite overwrapped pressure vessel COPV is most advanced ever made Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions Extremely robust literally bulletproof
Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean slight up or downward force on the wheel not really hold the wheel
The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment not carefully crafted corporate bs which is really just banal propaganda
Trade is just that Roadster becomes a seater instead of a COPV in place of the kid seats which is prob wise for many reasons
years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the fetchjoystickstate function

Engels wrote 2nd 3rd volumes based on Marxs notes Less reliable
Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable clean energy extend life as we know it beyond Earth Those problems require a lot of hardware
I dont want to see anyone lose their money Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens as I have done in the past
Weve always provided healthcare hourly wages above union Tesla stock Also free drinks snacks Try to make it fun too Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth 1M to 2M Nobody wants UAW so UAW keeps trashing Tesla me via 3rd parties
Good points Already mostly working in the developer software Im driving
And I dont trust that Engels guy He could have made up most of 2nd 3rd volumes Nobody actually knows
Iain certainly wasnt prounion in the Culture books At all And wouldnt be in the case of Tesla Banks was about freedom through through Maybe for a single buyer monopsony vs single seller monopoly I would be too but thats a special case
Dude we are California which is extremely pro union People can form a union tomorrow nothing Tesla could do to stop it UAW cant even get enough sigs to request a vote cause they have nothing to offer
Cant wait for the new season to start
Profit just means you earned more money than you spent certainly does spark innovation Jesus This is obv a good thing extremely hard It has taken Tesla years were almost there Every other US car company besides Ford Tesla has gone bankrupt
You think all companies are bad all unions good Thats a very bigoted position
I think essential services incl health care should be taken care of by govttaxpayers socialist other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people capitalist Aka the view held by most of America
Wow you know nothing are worthy of contempt The world is under massive attack due to climate change you couldnt care less
Youre just a trollbot but I will reply anyway I arrived in Montreal at by myself with No support no contacts nothing Father said Id fail be back in months
Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon as people said I was high if though it could work so I named it after their insult
Im not against all unions but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over Dont want Tesla to die too
I am too of sorts Govt ie other taxpayers should take care of critical needs of people incl defense judiciary health care etc Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people
I endorse freedom to form a union too as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company UAW has major conflicts of interest failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in Tesla can only hire of applicants so must be doing something right
UAW doesnt have of signatures about people needed for a vote They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq Instead theyre getting paid trolls far left shills to trash Tesla me in press social media Such creeps
which clearly doesnt work UAW Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla Storm clouds are gathering so theyre getting desperate

Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car understand how they come together I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid or now
Btw if anyone else wants to build this tunnel please do so Its a lot of work
Thanks for coming by our car factory with Tesla team was super fired up to see you Congrats on your victory
He had a way with words
Crazy that was over years ago Thanks for believing in us
We power the press in Ironic
That would be tricky to sequence but maybe
Apply light force to the steering wheel Alert is being changed to this text
Expanding the tour soon So many cool things to see Tesla car factory has 3rd largest footprint of any building on Earth Maybe 1st if you include all our sweet tents
Thanks for the feedback will investigate
There is more but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals With people the worst in will have issues Thats still people
At Fremont until late tonight Giga tomorrow Fremont Sunday GA4 is great but have to say that GA3 crew is pulling off miracles against all odds
Its actually pretty fun building electric cars Product is useful to other people good for environment I think thats fundamental goodness
Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesnt change even if you get a job Productivity should be rewarded
When I was a kid I built model airplanes trainsets rockets mixed my own powder explosives kinda surprised I still have all fingers a radio lots of software Built a primitive MRI machine in college

Appreciate all the good wishes First bday Ive spent in the factory but its somehow the best
Youre welcome Ryan McCaffrey Jun This is crazy in a good way Since I placed my order the following things have happened Biggerbetter sport brakes added Red brake calipers added Aluminum pedals added And the price went DOWN by I am ECSTATIC right now Now I just need it in my garage
Pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V high power tools in field all day No generator needed

Then you will really hate that Tesla scored four years in a row on LGBTQ equality Tesla Dec Very proud to have scored for the fourth year in a row in LGBTQ equality Thanks to everyone at Tesla for making LGBTQ inclusion an important part of our culture
This Washington Post article seems good washingtonpostcom Analysis Factchecking immigration spin on separating families lost children Separating immigrant families is a Trump administration policy not a Democratic one as the president says And kids were not lost
We need more better emojis nowSeriously So little to work with
We should always be concerned about the welfare of children those who cannot protect themselves wherever they may be but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan often inaccurate
Important to read the Wash Post article The unable to account for number does not refer to actual lost children It refers to calls not answered or returned in a day period
Virtue signaling is super annoying there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks but jump on every social cause du jour But Im really proud of the fact that of changes Tesla had to make to achieve before even knowing about the LGBTQ index was zero
Thats cool One of my favorite lines Monty Python is so brilliant
A billion at most so max Still basically in the nick of time from an ageofEarth standpoint
of the children remained where they were placed had moved had run away five were deported That left migrant children Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHSs phone calls after days does not mean the children are missing

Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks Less likely to work given tricky contours but great if it does
With some mods this could also work as an escape pod in space
Extremely talented dive team Makes sense given monsoon Godspeed BBC Breaking News Jul The complex mission to rescue the trapped boys their football coach from a cave in Thailand has begun Follow our live page for more updates Show this thread
Got more great feedback from Thailand Primary path is basically a tiny kidsize submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull Light enough to be carried by divers small enough to get through narrow gaps Extremely robust
Continue to be amazed by the bravery resilience tenacity of kids diving team in Thailand Human character at its best
Thanks for letting us use your pool
It is an honor to work with them

Pretty close There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit
Construction complete in about hours then hour flight to Thailand
Will do Even if not useful here perhaps it will be in a future situation
Yes Allweather 300kmh high altitude winds 60kmh ground winds Its a beast
According to divers who have made the journey this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid minisub
Given Chiang Rai airport hours soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago but cave now closed for diver rescue Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future
Testing for more hours in LA then its on a plane to Thailand
Yeah that sounds cool Music makes things better Calms the mind Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio phonemusic player
Diver weight belts wrapped around outside Minisub only weighs 40kg dry so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave then add weight belts for wet sections

Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights adjust bouyancy

Building doublelayer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks frontrear rope tow hitch lead pockets for neutral buoyancy cm oval Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA Do the divers think something like this might work
Python is done right Great name story too
Prob wise to add an air tank butt end fwd to take impacts in nose of pod vent valve in rear Set air tank to slow bleed rate then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator Training unnecessary less susceptible to panic attack
Tight control code is always C
Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate unless there is a very big hole If oxygen is dropping suggests that leak holes are not large
Yeah thats what Im talking about in that tweet doublelayer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating Other approach is a long inflatable air sock Both worth trying

Just finished an amazing day visit to China The world has never seen human energy vigor at such scale Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team potential for the future
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people We were asked to create a backup option worked hard to do so Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile Now its there for anyone who needs it in future Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing
Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China Very thoughtful about the longterm future
For now reply to my tweet with ppm ppb test results will send someone to install a water filter Creating email flintcom but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow
Whether you plan to buy a Dual Motor Performance Model or not take it for a test drive anyway Its like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you want
Glad to hear that Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications
Happy birthday Malala Happy to support
I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
Youre right on both counts Most houses in Flint have safe water but theyve lost faith in govt test results Some houses are still outliers Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good
They should go where their heart takes them but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics engineering
Performance version suspension is 1cm lower has stronger brakes in upgrade package
It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter I suppose that is what religion tells us Wonder what I should do differently

Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation
Thanks for correcting me I meant to say over half a million people
Yes Caves are now filled with water again Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level Little kids can walkswim in when low but it can be deadly to pro divers when high Pump generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue
Definitely Cant wait to try that Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters but back at it soon
The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave They stopped shortly after boys were rescued water level rose to roof level all way back to cave That was great work

Thanks Jack To be clear I am not a conservative Am registered independent politically moderate Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me I dont understand why they are not important to everyone
As this wellwritten article suggests my words were spoken in anger after Mr Unsworth said several untruths suggested I engage in a sexual act with the minisub which had been built as an act of kindness according to specifications from the dive team leader
Nonetheless his actions against me do not justify my actions against him for that I apologize to Mr Unsworth to the companies I represent as leader The fault is mine mine alone

Definitely We gave up some grip width in exchange for range Would recommend stickier tires wider on rear for best performance You might get sec mph or better with optimized rims tires
Phew Yeah we had a drain block months ago people are working hard to make Tesla successful Am honored to work with them Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job What motivates you
Yes that will probably be its first use
Makes me very sad indeed but also the fault is mine by far
Yeah great point Underground power lines would clear up the skyline be safer to service have better uptime save lives of many birds

Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play There will be no obligation to do so
engines but with room to add more down the road Kinda have to
Youre most welcome Sorry for the delay
Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia concentration of mass around center of a Tesla to the extent of our knowledge is better than any other production car This positively affects safety handling driving feel Extremely important metric
A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
Yes if there is no listener a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound
Helps improve forward crumple zone length especially important in high speed frontal impacts moments of inertia in side impacts
Consider an ice skater Same weight but spinsturns much faster with arms in vs arms out Same principle is true for a car
Yes albeit a beta version Will improve with V9
Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
Longterm there will be thousands eventually hopefully millions of missions anyone will be able to go
Front vs rear wheel weight distribution though commonly asked isnt the right question You can have on front on rear still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center Dumbbell mass distribution is bad spinning topdreidel is good
Will see what we can do Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible Its not sustainable longterm
Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia other important car terms at
Exactly all star are not the same as the videos show star just means a car met a certain threshold but injury probability stats real numbers tell you by how much

If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows sell Otherwise buy
Exactly Shortsellers are value destroyers Should definitely be illegal
When something sounds too good to be true it usually is Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to of short interest revenue but suffer almost none of equity decline as theyre just passive managers Blackrock made 597M in short lending last year
Sorry about the typo That was unforgivable Why would they be upset about their mission Its what they do
The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
Tesla Autopilot team is awesome Got to make sure we iron out the details though Long tail of tricky edge cases Important to get front wide angle B pillar side repeater camera neural nets just right
Two one for millions of years from now one for you
Yes but in that were creating a generalized autonomy solution Must work in millions of strange situations
There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts as it dilutes the shareholder base gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible including regulators
The big funds can will as theyre suffering a net loss Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for passive index tracking
Where this breaks down is in passive index funds which constitute most of the market The holders of those funds mostly small investors retirement funds dont realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers diminishing their true equity return
Debatably true if applied to individual stocks selectively consciously but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market without clear consent of the shareholder

To be clear actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article V9 vs V8 is more like a increase in useful opssec due to enabling integrated GPU better use of discrete GPU
Comes with free towels Nothing more useful in the entire Universe
This is without the Tesla NN computer Per my public comments that will give the car an extra order of magnitude
The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
months before it is in all new production cars No change to sensors This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full selfdriving

Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time
This game is my personal favorite but I am biased towards space stuff
Also available off menu for a week Was causing too much confusion
Its a long range battery with fewer cells Noncell portion of the pack is disproportionately high but we can get it done now instead of February
True but this will improve dramatically over next several months all Tesla cars ever produced except early Roadsters will get improvements for free Continuous free overtheair software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time

Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Exactly There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store
There have been hundreds of improvements to fit finish over the years but no major step change in this regard Seats especially are dramatically better now than in the past
S is better but rear seat folds down in Model so bikes can fit in trunk

It was underpriced Anyway if you want refund free Supercharging turned off we will do that
The FOIA on this will be solid gold Cant wait
Reddits twitter account is lame because its not real Reddit
We will enable track mode for all performance cars
Reddit is massive but def has gems
Youre right Earlier Model Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging Will add that to anyone who bought recently
Its a reasonable criticism We wanted to make the awesome version of Model Performance more affordable but it was arguably too much too soon Taking corrective action
Not exactly We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance No problem if you want to return the car but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal
Yeah or free lifetime Supercharging whichever you prefer
Ok we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging give you refund

Longterm the car will work purely on vision with radar just a plus but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway
Yes Germany has outstanding engineering talent
Hopefully partial presence in India Africa South America end of next year with broader expansion in
To clarify further the longterm goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets at least at the continent level This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible
Tesla will manufacture all battery modules packs at China Giga as we do today in California Nevada Cell production will be sourced locally most likely from several companies incl Pana in order to meet demand in a timely manner
Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions not just major metros in North America Eastern Europe China Japan by end of next year We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases

That is true should be applauded Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies but move rapidly towards clean sustainable energy Means lower profits shortterm but will make them stronger longterm
Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
Wont land propulsively for those reasons Ultra light heat shield high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry I think we have a handle on propulsive landings
Agreed top priority for Autopilot team Being cautious for max safety
Agreed technically mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient decayed marine organisms partially from geological processes CH4 particularly
No were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica Texas

Would be fun to add to Tesla
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries All things considered its better to use trucks Single loadunload direct to owner location
Will also be using dedicated rollon rolloff fast ships for transporting cars to Europe Asia in Q1 Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently
We bought some trucking companies secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
Probably technically able to do so in about a year Then up to regulators
Watchtower feat knight will be at LAHawthorne tunnel entrance
Probably some deliveries in March but April is more certain
We have to truck to departure rail head truck from arrival rail head which is usually from customers Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too trains dont leave often

Supercharger V3 which starts rolling out early next year will also charge much faster

No were just going to accelerate BFR
Maybe interesting to work with DaimlerMercedes on an electric Sprinter Thats a great van We will inquire
Lot on our plate so its either get van gliders no battery powertrain or compute tech from Daimler produce sooner or do all produce later Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way Priority list is Model Y solar roof tiles pickup semi Roadster
China especially is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation transport
No its the first or boost stage analogous to but much larger than Falcon
Yes no upgrades planned for F9 Minor tweaks to improve reliability only provided NASA USAF are supportive
Tesla can provide heatingcoolinglightsmusic for days using battery
No but perhaps in a few years
Ideal situation in breakdownaccident assuming no injuries is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with topoftheline service loaner
It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Yeah good idea We have that state internally so can push data to phone app
What really matters is time to volume production not initial market intro Apart from brief moments Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output
No its got enough load capacity volume to carry the battery pack our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster Still it would probably only save about to of effort all things considered
In order of resource priority but not necessarily production ramp as that depends on thousands of parts processes which are extremely difficult to forecast
Not everywhere but should be possible around major metros Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed Lmk if not
Should be possible Please ask service lmk response

Congratulations What an amazing track record of success with Mars
This is completely backwards Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda
Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time electrekco Watch a Tesla Model S drive or swim through a flooded tunnel Video With the advent of electric transport some people are worried about what happens when an electric vehicle is submerged under water following a storm or during a flood Theres a misconception that
Varies per person but about sustained peaking above at times Pain level increases exponentially above
Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
We tried Nintendo wont license it to us
Yeah good idea to offer that as a setting
Were doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network Thought we might need a NS test tunnel hence Sepulveda proposal but were just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing 2M views
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time enabling an intact landing in water Ships en route to rescue Falcon
None shall pass The Boring Company Dec Final round of interviews Show this thread
Falcon fairing halves missed the net but touched down softly in the water Mr Steven is picking them up Plan is to dry them out launch again Nothing wrong with a little swim
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled so Falcon landed just out to sea Appears to be undamaged is transmitting data Recovery ship dispatched
Yes cutaway was a mistake We will show all footage good or bad
We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
It is so hard to move in armor
Pump is single string Some landing systems are not redundant as landing is considered ground safety critical but not mission critical Given this event we will likely add a backup pump lines
Not worth going below imo Even is still fine Also no issue going to or lower SoC
Incoming rocket fairing probably visible but landing itself is over the horizon
Exactly Default Autopilot behavior if theres no driver input is to slow gradually to a stop turn on hazard lights Tesla service then contacts the owner Looking into what happened here
Reentry scorchmarks not simple soot Cant wipe it off
Perhaps most telling is that Norway which is partly above the Arctic Circle has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth
Were adding police car fire truck ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
As the battery warms up almost all of that is recovered There is a roughly range loss for cabin heating Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic but range is also higher in slow traffic
Prof Dahn is correct hes great but the relative benefit is small Id recommend more SoC for convenience
Three things one of which is CH4
Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar located just below nose of car should help Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it Were also working on visiononly driving

This is a very misleading edit Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence

Im dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year
No need to wait Its super easy to swap the HW2 HW3 computers Sensors are the same
Seems likely that well be able to reuse fairings that softlanded in the ocean May not need net at all Would still love to see the catch happen though
Youre right There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story
Mins actually had several hours of interview time which they distilled to mins Many stories could been told with that time This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party
Pretty good I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build interventions are rare Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month
Were opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year including Knoxville Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week
The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant You can spill red wine on the seats just wipe it off

Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX Tesla TESLARATI Dec Elon Musk voted by SpaceX Tesla employees as one of s Best CEOs
Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a ft tunnel in LA for 10M with V1 Godot Next tunnel will be made with V2 LineStorm V3 Prufrock aspirationally 10X better should be operational next year For reference bloombergcom Why Does Urban Rail Cost So Much in the US Its not just the Second Avenue Subway Nearly all urban rail projects in the US cost much more than their European counterparts
This can be applied to any autonomous electric vehicle not just Tesla
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians cyclists
If all vehicles were densely seated buses throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is possible but better to offer a range of vehicles let people decide what makes them happy
A variety of vehicles like normal roads from a small car to a densely seated bus Must be seated belted for high speed safety
Same facts same period of time but extremely different reporting
Totally false Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiels Founders Fund we have no concerns whatsoever
Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every minutes Hope you have a Merry Christmas
Same applies to those who didnt order PUP
Actually way more capacity way faster way more convenient Subways are fine but its time to upgrade to something better
Yeah it would allow many streets to become parks walking areas Less concrete more trees
Yeah I wrote that back in almost years ago
This is affordable mass transit but better in that it takes you where when you to go
Youre right We did have a sim ready but it was confusing so I didnt include it Were working on one that makes things clear
Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
I know that area well Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St
So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart most of the stress will flow around them but this wont matter for the first few layers
Exactly Its a good way to go Get people with more money to pay for the development
The guides are basically just a wheel a shock absorber a solenoid Costs a few hundred dollars in volume
Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure Turns will definitely be banked in future
Probably only need three types straight ramp spiral ramp elevator Latter only for tight spaces
Reverse back down using same roller guide wheels so no skill required tow or flatbed it out
Passive lateral safety is required by regulators I think theyre right Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing there is probably a good safety argument
Medieval Futurism Pauline Acalin Dec Just drove by I literally dont even know how to caption this epic scene
Please put invented car fart on my gravestone This is my only request
At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
If Tesla committed delivery customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
Putting in little outwardfacing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
Thanks hope you have a good holiday Your insight on autonomy is excellent
Skin will get too hot for paint Stainless mirror finish Maximum relfectivity
Starship will look like liquid silver
Yes Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month
Its embarrassing that BoeingLockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas but that engine design is brilliant
Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
Seriously We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO Mars no problem
Starlink V1 on Falcon V2 on Starship Basically all future products will contain either the word star or link
Yup Actually the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel were using a different alloy mix I super Series Stainless
Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational This allows rapid iteration on Raptor
While there are some material similarities Starship is very different from the Atlas design
You def dont want electric pumps on a rocket engine Raptor turbopumps alone need horsepower per engine Thats not a typo
No Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry Although maybe not
SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for psi hot oxygenrich gas It was hard Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions
Yes but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless Add Super Heavy rocket booster orbital payload is gigantic Only need booster on Earth due to deep gravity well thick atmosphere Starship alone on moons Mars
When its no longer noticeable over Plancks length
For sheetplate at supplier made to our spec For cast in our Hawthorne foundry
Yes full flow gasgas staged combustion Will take us time to work up to bar That is a mad level
This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m ft just not full height Super Heavy will be full height diameter
Were building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
Excited to have Larry Ellison Kathleen WilsonThompson join the Tesla board
Yes Supercharger coverage will extend to of Europe next year From Ireland to Kiev from Norway to Turkey Paul Kelly Dec Missing some locations out of Dublin Ireland south towards Waterford Badly needs some as no Ccs on that route that works Any plans for more here Should be in a model x in weeks or so

Tesla team did a great job
This is incorrect Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car
Thanks Tesla owners in China Looking forward to visiting soon for the groundbreaking of Gigafactory Shanghai
We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
Definitely All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers all the way to Brownsville across Mexico
Probability at rising rapidly due to new architecture
Time Although it also turned out to be dramatically better
I will provide a detailed explanation in MarchApril
Hope everyone has a happy New Year

Shanghai Giga production of Model Y will serve greater China region
Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of Y for greater China All Model SX higher cost versions of Model Y will still be built in US for WW market incl China
Im not Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite overwrapped pressure vessel in place of the rear seats
Aiming to finish initial construction this summer start Model production end of year reach high volume production next year
Plus you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance
Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China not North America Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers
Yes will be extremely intense Early flights are especially dangerous as theres a lot of new hardware
Aiming for weeks which probably means weeks due to unforeseen issues
More on this in a few months
Engines currently on Starship hopper are a blend of Raptor development operational parts First hopper engine to be fired is almost finished assembly in California Probably fires next month
I dont think the law fully anticipated this situation So probably yes for a while
Spiralwinding is great for uniform thickness We used that for the Hyperloop vacuum tunnel However Starship skin thickness will vary considerably according to loads

The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla give them months of free Supercharging please do so before then
How many electric vehicle startups are there Seems like a lot
About 15Mkm for a two way high speed transit so probably around 750M plus maybe 50Mstation
The source info is incorrect Starship Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne CA We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas as their size makes them very difficult to transport
Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
No the whole referral incentive system will end
I think some of them should combine forces Talent is spread too thin
Yes ending on Feb Its adding too much cost to the cars especially Model
Dragon was originally designed to land with thrusters but its not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings

310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin as it can take Kelvin so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate degrees of delta temp

is peak heating expected on about of Starship for LEO entry on Rest drops below so no heat shield needed Radiative cooling at T takes care of of the ship Another reason for steel
Since its part of safety security all cars with AP2 hardware will get it
I just heard mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night fairing was blown over Will take a few weeks to repair
Yes Also despite high outside heat rapid water vaporization can counterintuitively cause it to snap freeze block cooling channels

Im openly moderate There I said it
No plans to do so Would recommend Model S
We will when it rolls out
Well my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart
That might be the ultimate superpower
Absolutely Youve touched on a very important point The ship must be easy to repair on the moon Mars
To be clear Im confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber because of strength to weight vs temperature reduced need for heat shielding
Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminumlithium vs stainless full hard at cryo but latter costs way less is tougher doesnt even need paint
Will probably make booster legsflaps same as ship instead of like F9
Youre most welcome Very thoughtful questions
Haha how is this even real
Yes ship needs pitchrollyaw control across wide Mach regime angle of attack
And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming selfpowered by solar
Still up to Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up
Yes Its very rare to find all three
Cold gas thrusters only Will use body flaps main engines for landing orientation so wont need high thrust reaction control Simplifies things considerably
Well tweak the alloy over time so it wont exactly be but close
Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship Super Heavy
I want you too baby Mars Feb I dont want you Only Elon tcoNKxpkQQRyf
First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine So proud of great work by team
Design requires at least metric tons of force Engine reached mT bar chamber pressure with warm propellant which means to more with deep cryo

Sorry many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow
Welded internal longitudinal hat stringers To the degree it may need hoop stiffness prob not combine with slosh baffles
Exactly Both prices are shown right next to each other lower price is actually the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car In fact for many states in the US its way better
Prob wise for version to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners main chamber
Engine use methox torch igniters Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber
Will do although SpaceX reddit is very wellinformed Really impressive analysis by some commenters
Technically the steel is radiatively cooled not uncooled T is one of the most interesting things about reality
Booster center of mass is much lower more consistent no payload mass to consider so still biases towards engine first entry
Rocket booster temperatures wont go much above Kelvin on hottest parts of main body maybe around on base which uncooled steel can handle Starship is around for a Mach entry so needs shielding of some kind

Moon first Mars as soon as the planets align
The goodwill of the public is critical to Starships success
This will sound implausible but I think theres a path to build Starship Super Heavy for less than Falcon
Very dependent on volume but Im confident moving to Mars return ticket is free will one day cost less than maybe even below Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth move to Mars if they want
I think where we lit main chamber several with only preburners
Definitely Its amazing that the RD RD engines held the record for so many decades Excellent engineering
Yes aiming for sec Isp with vac nozzle Maybe if we get lucky
Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress setbacks Will be some RUDs along the way but excitement is guaranteed
Yeah but simpler Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble
A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
But not an extendable nozzle though as that just saves length Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter
Propellant was not deep cryo CH4 O2 were just barely below liquid temp at bar In theory Raptor should do bar at deep cryo provided everything holds together which is far from certain However only bar is needed for nominal operation of StarshipSuper Heavy
Starship Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version Very important as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon even though liquid oxygen is vehicle mass helium weighs basically nothing
Much above bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of to bar Definitely pushing the limit of known physics
Of course I still love you

True that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality
Agreed Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location
I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering manufacturing problems at Tesla especially SpaceX
Also Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI I didnt agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do Add that all up it was just better to part ways on good terms
It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues then if that looks good speed up next week We def need to add a Request Latest Update feature

Its designed to be way better Well see what reality has to say about that
Deorbits burns up over the Pacific
Advanced reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization Once we have a city on Mars interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight
SN2 has changes that should help
Including Heavy which is cores around or so
Upper stage is flight except mass sim in place of Merlin It will get fragged for sure by aero loads Dragon abort thrusters
Actually they received still receive almost a billion dollars a year for launch capability Even if they do zero launches US govt still gives them that
Always liked Kestrel It was the Robin Hood of engines
We are constrained by the accredited investor rule but will think about how this could be done
Exactly Thats the critical point for StarshipBFR more payload than the biggest rocket ever made but for less money per launch than the smallest orbital rocket Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X humanity will never be a multiplanet species
Not true Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine liquidgas or gasgas is pressure temperature in oxygen preburner
Merlins The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN as expected A lot of the parts are fine for reuse but next tests will be with SN which is almost done
SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion eg SSME or RD but it has world record for thrustweight thrustcost engine Raptor has better Isp but Im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics
Pinter injector tends to have hot cold streaks Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion
Exactly Super money move is antimatter drive especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space
Essentially yes Great engineering talent but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon selfsustaining city on Mars
Yeah that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure ablative dont get along Ok for low pressure expendable upper stage
Thats true Merlin 1A was terrible 1C was ok 1D good but block Merlin should probably be called 1E is something special Took about years to get there
Meetings are a valuable use of time
SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript which clearly states to How embarrassing
Thank you Evelyn I loved it
Because it costs to transport to east coast everyone pays same
Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways advanced summon autopark
Should be peak power increase with March software release
Exactly This has now happened several times Something is broken with SEC oversight
Scheduled for March release along with many other improvements
Indeed I have great respect for judges Its not perfect but in general we should be very glad of the US justice system
Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin Kestrel Draco other engine developments from start through that were critical to SpaceXs success Great respect appreciation
I think we should do something here Will talk with team send out a note in next few days
Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active so only fulltime equivalent people right now That will grow a lot as we enter production Its 10X harder at least to design engine production system than engine In automotive 100X harder
Maybe active in a month or so Focus right now is getting to high speed tight follow distance in test tunnel
Printers are too small Also high pressure high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an incosteel jacket Cant print yet

Tesla comms is fixing That was a mistake
Gap in understanding is that Model production starts this month but will not reach volume production until mid year Extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing Scurve
Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by top speed by kmh or 7mph
No that unveil is later this year
No just literally having toast jam while playing Jamming
Power will increase on all cars Top speed on 3P increases to 162mph Range on RWD increases to miles
Thank you May you have good luck godspeed with your spacecraft
Need to get back to SpaceX launch control Sorry this solution isnt perfect
Yes Personally Im most excited by the Tesla Truck Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people but I love it
Were trying to make EVs autonomy more affordable over time This is the right thing to do However we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company
Will take a few days for system update
Model S will be raised to 162mph too
Yes she would be able to breathe
Its not exactly symmetric but it will come with HW3 upgrade longterm
Slightly higher drag slightly higher frontal area affects air friction mass affects rolling resistance hill climb Physics is the law
Yeah we need a few days to update the system If anyone already paid they should get back

Atmospheric entry at mph is like a meteor will vaporize steel Burn marks below are on cold side Main heatshield on bottom SpaceX Mar Crew Dragon is on SpaceXs recovery vesselcompleting the spacecrafts first test mission
All good system maintained room temperature within spacecraft
If you navigate to Supercharger car will warm up battery en route so you start immediately at max power
Yes but an engine shouldnt count until it flies
Thank you on behalf of SpaceX We have always admired your rocketspacecraft technology
Dragon was designed to land using thrusters with parachutes as backup Switched to chutes as primary due to difficulty of proving safety but Dragon can still do it youtubecom Dragon Propulsive Hover Test On November SpaceXs Dragon powered by eight SuperDraco engines executed a pictureperfect propulsive hover test at the companys rocket development
Youre most welcome Very proud of Tesla team Super tough years
Raptor on way to Hopper Will be mounted to vehicle next week
We will spend or months with public beta of V3 in North America make sure there are no corner case issues then begin buildout worldwide
For cargo missions propulsive land landing should be no problem Doesnt have same safety criticality as crew
Probably right Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon Dragon although theyre critical to getting there dInnovationdt is what matters longterm
Best to use a giant brake pad aka heat shield
Most likely but this is contingent upon NASA review approval
Very little power only right before you get to the Supercharger You wont notice it in range
Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays updated software with battery warmup results in 2X improvement in fleet charge time
Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm

Tesla car prices go up next week except for Model Order online at before then for current prices teslacom Electric Cars Solar Clean Energy Tesla Tesla is accelerating the worlds transition to sustainable energy with electric cars solar integrated renewable energy solutions for homes businesses
There was something but no one caught it

Longterm its about coupling the collective will of humanity to AI Shortterm its about improving the lives of those with brain or spine problems
Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
Next software update will increase storm watch sensitivity Youre right its currently too low
When prices go down those who already bought want the lower price but if prices go up those who already bought dont want to write Tesla a check So it goes
Our list prices are our actual prices Software automotive vary prices frequently by changing the discount or rebate
However this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
We are still closing stores just not as many as before This basically splits the difference about half as many stores closed but then can afford only about half the price reduction Was discussed with exec team board
Software release later this week should make it better
Plug in a USB drive to record video
It also feels way bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside

First really short hops with one engine Suborbital flights with three
Whitehot parts reached orbital entry temp of around Kelvin
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day thats fine
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing Zero refurbishment
Might arrive by June but def before end of summer
Still get this question a lot even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on super appreciated Also AWD is nice to have but def not required for snowice
Only some of the hottest sections
Hopefully Always many issues integrating engine stage First hops will lift off but only barely
Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica Texas Cape Kennedy Florida Will also be building Starship Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations
We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper Dont need it What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle
Raptor is very complex even for a staged combustion engine Were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration Throttling down to is hard but manageable Going to would be extremely tough but hopefully not needed
Model partial permanent magnet induction motor especially with silicon carbide inverter is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses then range of dual might be higher but thats a lot of complexity
Exactly In fact better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD but it isnt critical for snowy regions
Definitely down the road once construction upgrades arent so crazy
This causes some media confusion as batch builds ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month terrible following month but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much Massive month over month changes are usually because of productionshipping schedules
Not exactly same time as countries have different regulations we try to build in batches to simplify production
Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side no shield needed on leeward side transpiration cooling on hotspots
Started rolling it out a few days ago Always starts slow find rare corner case issues fix them continue rollout
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump combustion chamber Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump called a gas generator That has to throttle way deeper than the main chamber
Falcon rocket booster is aluminumlithium carbon fiber which have low max temperature allowables Super Heavy booster is stainless steel Since it only goes to around Mach or moreover at high altitude it needs no heat shield not even paint

Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer which is an order of magnitude more capable For now its slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer as our software is more refined for HW2
No it is one week either way
Glad you like it Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon
Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or finslegs Best choice for the impatient Ion engines are too slow
Probably no fairing either just Raptor Vacuum engines Mass ratio of tons full tons empty with Isp of Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with Isp MR Spread out see whats there Not impossible
I think so For sure worth giving it our best shot Would be great to have a competitive commercial program to build a moon base that is outcomeoriented not costplus so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo
Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks
Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor but it sure sounds like you could be right Will investigate
Instagram comments are coding in emojis
Like the movie Us Scary but also empathetic
Yes Sensitive propulsion avionics remained dry Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team Major improvement over Dragon
Yes otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high andor center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained Yes but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads
Were going to try Side boosters come back to Cape center core lands on droneship Latter will be coming in v hot fast so dicey
Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy cant This is absolutely false FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct but thats very rare
No but for sure the other way around
Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you cant hear but you can feel in your chest
Yeah Falcon Heavy Block has way more performance than last years vehicle Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer max Q without changing any parts FH Block can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying

Im sorry Fred but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade They cant all be chalked up to poor reporting Where are the WSJ expos pieces on oil coal gas That industry is times bigger than Tesla Perhaps theyre all angels
There will be that too but economics will favor initial purchase
Hopefully have the order page live before then If not will push price change out a bit later
There is GWhyr theoretical capacity but actual max output is It was physically impossible to make more Model s in Q1 due to cell constraints
Ive always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport energy
Not good enough yet Pushing release by a few weeks Will be amazing
Your interventions do train the NN but we first verify that the training doesnt cause other issues so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
Very much so There are 5B cars trucks on Earth Even replacing of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year Tesla will make over cars in next months but thats a mere of 25M or of global vehicle fleet Car industry slow demand supply
Yes this was an utter boldface literally lie Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false

Launch in mins SpaceX May Webcast of first Starlink launch now live
Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
Krypton ion thrusters activate in about hours to raise orbit
Two tunnels about a mile long each
Ironically same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value imply Tesla is worthless They cant both be true
Yes No one will forced to take the tunnel Its optional
Paperwork hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
Opposite is true you can have s of layers of tunnels but only one layer on surface to first approximation therefore trains should be on surface cars below
Yes but you get to your destination so quickly directly that it doesnt matter
Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX looking at rocket
Makes no sense In order to grow the colony youd have to transport vast amounts of mass from planetsmoonsasteroids Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean
LA has a subway but most people dont know about it
Hoping for sec Isp but at least Otherwise similar to sea level version
Gary the still crushes us Wouldnt be fair But TBC might give him a run for his money next year
First flights would have fewer so as to risk less loss of hardware Probably around
Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
Exactly Still pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed
Yeah Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe inner engines have high gimbal range degrees
Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in near vacuum conditions Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly at high angle for landing Larger nozzle leaves less room to move increases moment of inertia
Aiming for tons useful load in fully reusable configuration but should be at least tons allowing for mass growth
Turbines on hot side outer fanlooking things in this depiction but this is just to illustrate the type of engine Our turbopumps are vertical have fanlooking things on pump side complex crossflow Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber
N2 for vacuum Aero surfaces high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere
Part of the factory is being upgraded but tours will continue around the parts that arent
Great ad Audi USA May Think you know electric Think again With quattro allwheel drive the fullyelectric etron SUV is ready for the road ahead
Beautiful solar sail SpaceX May Starlink satellites are equipped with one solar array instead of two minimizing potential points of failure
I paid most of my Teslarelated expenses too Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me
Krypton thrusters operative satellites initiating orbit raise every mins
If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments thats easily done Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw as shown by this NASA density map
Would love to do exactly that
Great video Couple notes Raptor designed for subcooled CH4O2 so propellant density thrust increase up to as needed for mission Isp up to thrustweight improvement over time Merlin thrustweight doubled from V1 but Raptor is closer to optimum
Yeah the fear uncertainty doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights
No Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors which we believe achieves highest theoretical mixingcombustion efficiency
Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars their future resale value cars will be low Consumers are starting to realize this
Agreed sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction Well get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits arrays are tracking to sun
Only a tiny amount There is enough air to affect the satellites allow some amount of yaw steering
Exactly potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good That said well make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy We care a great deal about science
Precisely sats will be in darkness when stars are visible
ISS is extremely gigantic has lights
True Im a gamer my boys are too Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games
One days grace taking into account time zone confusion Will revert tomorrow
Exactly A car being electric upgradable to full selfdriving maximizes future resale value
Rotate on one axis Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels
Yes already planned We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy
Propellant stays same but almost everything else improves Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars
Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially sub 10ms over time with much greater consistency than terrestrial links as only ever a few hops to major data centers
Stop sending me this tron Audi Loun May Except that in french tron litteraly means shit Well done
This is my pet bee Eric
Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies Tesla has never had access to them
Were trying to simplify product complexity so only offering white technically black white interior in high volume markets
Releasing to Early Access Program Tesla owners next week
Based on our data Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles we expect this to improve further
Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests Big auto oil companies arent known for their gentle behavior SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors space programs of national govts No walk in the park there
Wingsflaps leg design changing again sigh Doesnt affect schedule much though
Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk Model S X primary HEPA filter alone is literally bigger than normal car air filter
Exactly Were on the wrong planet for SSTO No problem on Mars or any of the moons
Also HEPA filter is expensive so would force increase in price
Yeah way better Dramatically improves cost complexity ease of operations Distances of km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach
Add to more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth You can go surprisingly far even with low liftdrag This was an unexpected result
Upcoming Falcon Heavy details Space Systems Command Jun SpaceXs Falcon Heavy center core powering SMCs STP mission arrived near Launch Complex39A in Florida over the weekend This hardware will return to SpaceXs Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Visit
No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline Its great to get thoughtful criticism
Tesla Superchargers service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph TBC loop can run at 155mph with pax autopods passing every second routing automatically between tunnels to their destination Thats hourlane you can build dozens of lanes Will crush any subway in throughput convenience
China EV subsidies mostly end this month fully end in about months
155mph is common on the Autobahn Even with only offramp tunnels exit speed drops to 31mph
Yes as you point out it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings
Norway Tesla Owners Online Jun As of March of new car sales in Norway are electric What are we doing wrong
Landing in the fog SpaceX Jun Falcon s first stage has landed on Landing Zone SpaceXs second land landing on the West Coast
True cost of operating a Tesla is much lower than other cars James Stephenson Jun Just rolled over miles this morning in THX ELON my TSLA Model Total energy consumed 993kWh making Whmi efficiency Total fuel cost centskWh Total Maintenance cost windshield washer fluid Most people have no clue
Annual tire rotation is actually optional Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire
Applies to a small number of Bay Area residents but worth checking out
Super fair criticism Were putting max resources on this Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway Please apply if interested
Absolutely agree Major expansion of service centers underway
Would be good to look up electricity rates by location optimize cost automatically
Good point Maybe we could collect rainwater add a little antifreeze in cold climates make it last for years

Colonizing Mars one mug at a time
We poured our heart soul into it Lot of hubris too but no regrets Faberg egg of cars
Most likely It is programmed to do so
High entry force heat breached engine bay center engine TVC failed
I know sigh Those are truly a work of art
Im such a bad public speaker Damn
Yes but we couldnt take a chance on 2nd stage failing its 4th maneuver This mission was more complex than anything Im aware of in history of rockets RIP center core you did your duty well
Yes I love botanical gardens This is my favorite
We worked so hard to create that exact view Seat rails flush with floor on a rearslanted monopost
There will be no Block Moving to Starship architecture
Sure Want to add easy importexport of images from your phone
That was our design approach in early days but fairing mass is much higher stability of booster in ground winds is low
as all seats would be coach no toilets pilot area or food galley needed Most flights would only be to mins Its basically an ICBM traveling at Mach that lands
About assuming people want cabins Pressurized volume is similar to A380 Could take a lot more on shorter trips
Waiting for Falcon Heavy to launch means high cortisol levels This is our toughest rocket launch ever
That would be unwise Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disneys Space Mountain roller coaster Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways but youd exit on another continent
One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard
High payloaddeltaV missions will always be far downrange Value of boost stage is measured essentially by horizontal velocity imparted to upper stage Altitude is almost unimportant
Almost anything Lengthdiameter is much lower Starship doesnt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail
Youre touching on a good critique of Falcon Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high Were fixing that with Starship
Frangible would def hurt reusability Also presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible

Reason for top rating is that active steering braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars wiredcom Tesla Model Can Survive a Crash Avoid One Too The Model scores well in European crash testing a day after Tesla reported a quarterly record for deliveries
Yes but still a bit too limited on range That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves
We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth becoming multiplanetary via Mars Its not clear how much time we have to do these things but sooner is definitely better
FWIW based on calcs I did years ago crossover point for Liion beating kerosene is Whkg High cycle batteries are just over Whkg today but probably exceed in years
Active safety will continue to improve via overtheair software updates Since all Tesla cars are connected we analyze each accident do our best to minimize probability of recurrence
Jet A kerosene has much higher energy density than Liion but electric motors weigh much less convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place Makes a world of difference for pedestrians cyclists especially

All HW2 cars are upgradable to full selfdriving capability with Tesla FSD computer all production in past few months has FSD computer
The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites More on this later
Will do Starship presentation a few weeks after Hopper hovers so prob late July If that timing works free LJ chips for all present
This is why its possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of make at least FSD cars
To be clear consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla but the clearing price will rise significantly as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a nonautonomous car
Between first development engine first flight engine with operational payload there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware software Over time thousands
Intersections with complex traffic lights shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios but massive effort required to get to safety
Production fully switched over months ago Functionality wont diverge until Q4 as its limited by software validation Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies
Overall successful Aborted at T sec on high mixture ratio but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions so not surprising

Yeah big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel not bothered by a little heat
Post test fuel leak but no major damage
I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer Our new Raven powertain adaptive damping suspension is great Next is Model 3P then X if driving with my kids Acceleration is fun on tap

Streaming Check Neuralink website later today Starts around 8pm
Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more nearterm applications
No matter how one considers the data there is a giant improvement from nonAutopilot to Autopilot
Is there a longer edit I can post
No since Tesla will charge a fee for being in our robotaxi fleet but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
If we make all cars with FSD package selfdriving as planned any such Tesla should be worth to as utility increases from hoursweek to hoursweek
Straw man fallacy To appreciate your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it so probably is enough if you bought a FSD will be bundled in all cars important point Something is not a commodity if you cant make enough of them we wont be able to

FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
Just spoke with FAA so hopefully yes
No plans to introduce air suspension on Model at this time
Probably every to months depending on how much progress we make
Will be needed for sure Bandwidth no problem latency is a challenge
Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals Likely September
Were working with EU regulators to improve rules Spirit of rules is correct but exact language doesnt quite align with spirit Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world
Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude so at ton cost would be 100B
Ultimately however what really matters is empirical safety Nothing in life is safe so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of mileskm per accident
Were accelerating opening up configuratororder page for more countries Sorry lot on our plate
Dont know enough about Georges company but it sounds like hes focused on a machine vision approach which is the only general solution imo
Good question NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted NCAP also great but there are some weird headlight angle factors Super inside baseball stuff

Um I ate most of it
Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk has Raptors moving body fins landing gear installed which is hopefully mid September
Everyone who bought FSD will receive priorityearly access
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
Dont know yet but its important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy so well make costs as low as possible
Trickier than it may seem on Mars as atmospheric density is that of Earth gravity is but doable for localized warming
Meaning less than a century But this would be pretty intense
Not risky imo can be adjustedimproved realtime Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy as Mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor the sun
Yeah would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters

Over time it will be sustainable
The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive Marshmellowlooking thing is a rope seal
Over time are possible but very difficult
Failure rate is actually both higher lower than that as the Falcon design has changed almost completely several times Currently flying version has no failures may fate continue to be merciful but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate
Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships but maybe we should Vac engines would be dual bell fixed no gimbal which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull
The mechanical attachment mechanism We need to make sure they wont fall off due to vibration acoustics
You know destination weather before departure theres no weather in space
Sea level Raptors vacuum Isp is sec but sec with larger vacuumoptimized nozzle
Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast We take it easy on the test stand but thats not indicative of capability
Everything happens so fast Its such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft Travels km in mins
No but that was an epic piece at a time when the word was being overrun by demented versions of an otherwise delightful jam container It was like World War Z but mason jars
Distance from fireball is at so if t is small you havent moved far even if a is high At 6g thrust youll only travel 03m in ms Pressure wave aka explosion with liquid rockets is low as ox fuel are poorly mixed If you can fly out of it youre prob ok

Wise words from Gary the Bot
Feeling Lucky Google tribute or Hungry are intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner If location has destination chargers thats a plus but car should only route there if location is great This will be hit miss initially but should hone towards excellent over time
Looking into this A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining
Maybe we can buffer enough of it onboard Will check
Yes thats exactly what I meant Gary the Bot
Thats what we believe is highly likely
Service center expansion is at max speed so yes
Sure Im planning on meeting community supporters around the presentation on the 28th Thanks

Going to early access including all who bought FSD Tesla owners in US next week If US early access rollout looks good then rest of world early access owners following week Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval
There arent really meant to be Tesla incentives just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to partially address shifts in tax incentives Overarching principle however is same deal for all
Should note that these product mix logistics errors also results in regional undersupply eg UK Ireland right now but we dont raise the prices even so The intent at any given moment in time is heads we lose tails buyers win
At end of quarter there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly global regions due to planning mistakes logistics problems Earth is a big place Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supplydemand imbalances
The fundamental operating principle is that prices while they may change will change for all equally should never be a function of bargaining This is normal for most products but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world
Thats not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous possibly overstepping our core principles which is why Im looking into it

OG Roadster is def helping us out here with 826M miles by itself
Better just to ride your max temp all the way down let T be your friend Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast so not crazy hot after landing
We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities So soon but hard to say exactly
It would be pretty embarrassing to use a nonTesla battery
Mk1 ship is around tons dry tons wet but aiming for by Mk4 or Mk5 Total stack mass with max payload is tons

This is quite a complex beast but hopefully within a month or so
For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth To Mars could maybe work single pass but two passes probably wise
Could do it but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling quite robust

Great summary of the key points
Its all the secondary structure that concerns me not engines primary airframe
Just SX500 so far but we use many superalloys developed by eg Inco If anyone has that would be helpful haha Massive engineering work in the casting printing machining of Raptor far more than in design of the engine itself
Well hopefully closer to bar over time However that the chambernozzle jacket has so many joints dissimilar metals at such high pressure temperature is what I find remarkable about it
Thats about right except no sensors Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot have to be replaced
No weve been focusing on production now on SN12 Only need bar or even a bit less for StarshipSuper Heavy Anything above is nice to have well get around to it but not needed for flight
I have that exact thought every time I get the flu

Deep Rain neural net coming soon Were not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets just this one because rain is deep
Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true TW Target is ton engine with tF Max Isp version should achieve sec but TW probably due to big nozzle These are just guesses for now
Were working on a simple initial version of Autopark Will be safe but sometimes park in silly places that arent actual parking spaces
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Couple months but V1 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal as optimized for speed of development Isp maybe to sec
Also were keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation so thats leaving a lot on the table
It is actually called deep rain as sort of a joke at Tesla Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when how fast to move the wipers
Oberth effect is not well appreciated Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple deltav equation One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2 enmwikipediaorg Oberth effect Wikipedia
Yeah gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control so most of impulse goes through vac engines
Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites Same goes for hydrogen oxygen also in shadowed craters
This is true All that matters is number used in v equation Propellant residuals are incredibly important often overwhelming engine mass enmwikipediaorg Deltav Wikipedia
We def could be wrong about this but its actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles Dont need a lot of room moment of inertia is much lower

Wow seems like eons ago With fairing recovery Falcon is reusable but reflight takes several days requires boats Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours ship reflight every hours No boats needed

Would be odd to expect anything else

As the planets align only once every two years
If we build as many Starships as Falcons so vehicles each does tons to orbit thats a capacity of million tons of payload to orbit per year
So it will take about years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
No in the beginning assuming you even make it there alive Mars will be far more dangerous difficult than Earth take decades of hard labor to make selfsufficient Thats the sales pitch Want to go
Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mindblowing metric as its designed to fly 3X per day which is 1000X per year
Without a fully rapidly reusable orbital rocket humanity will never be a multiplanet species
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
Current global payload to orbit capacity is about tons per year of which Falcon is about half
The audience of entrepreneurs should try it not the AF
No problem We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is whats hard
SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year so up to engines per year Most will be the as high as ton thrust but no throttle no gimbal variant for Super Heavy Cumulative thrustyear could thus be as high as tonsyear
Raptor is evolving rapidly Probably wouldnt consider it to be even V1 until roughly engine although probably engines can be retrofitted for orbital flight especially on Super Heavy which is less sensitive to engine variation It just needs crazy up force
Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant Other variants will have throttle

That will require a full redesign but probably inches or cm width
Yeah 320i that I bought in for I hotrodded it by jamming in a speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the speed transmission failed

Crew Dragon should be physically ready at the Cape in Feb but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months
Renewable energy production solar wind geothermal improving home insulation electric transport will do the trick Veganvegetarian helps a little but isnt critical We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness
No will be autogenous from the start tapping hot CH4 O2 from Raptor

I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals taking action of climate but these are mostly separate moral issues
Slight tweak to the glass needed then it should be good to go
Spin start from COPVs so the ox fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important
We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a ton car body press which costs much less for same outcome
Building prototypes is relatively easy volume production is hard
Beyond awesome He was the real deal
Tesla merch def needs some love but too many fish to fry rn
Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing but would require extensive testing to prove safety Better to focus on Starship
Were focusing on Boca right now for Starship Cape is focused on FalconDragon
Many ways to solve this problem but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces When moving giant body flaps rapidly achieving high power is much harder than high torque
Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working
Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors Is there a commercially available machine that can weld 4mm full hard stainless barrels domes
Moving to an enclosed fairly clean room environment for SN2 in Jan although unlike aluminum stainless steel welding is not super sensitive Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy which affects weld arc steel melt pool
Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW Its tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains

The sun is green peak photon frequency
Thanks for mentioning We shouldve done this ages ago
We tried to design a way to save B1046 but not possible
Very true Whats really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs how little of it is absorbed by Earth There is sooo much solar energy We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny of Earths surface which is a super tiny of energy emitted by the sun
A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps pressurestabilizerelieve compression load on the cylinder walls
Everything is compressible but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant However the tanks do expand under pressure creating a bit more volume Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of in case of CH4
Exactly Weve had good discussions with leading astronomers One way or another well make sure Starlink doesnt inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky

Fundamental issue with SLS is that its not reusable which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch tragedy
Helping to pay for this is why Im accumulating assets on Earth
Loading the Mars fleet into Earth orbit then ships depart over days every months Battlestar Galactica
Yes There will be a lot of jobs on Mars
Munros analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate both pro con I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design
Aiming for to years like aircraft
Densifying hydrogen is difficult as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero Much easier with CH4 which is an underappreciated advantage Cooling O2 is good too but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp as air is N2 Entire system wants to drip air
Yeah A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars
Whats amazing is how nonlinear the effect of gravity is Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars which is of Earth gravity
Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want with loans available for those who dont have money
Even more important for a a reusable rocket as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant anything below TW of is wasted fuel oxygen
Densification isnt needed to return the ship limited cargo from Mars but its an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed

Would like to take a moment to thank Michael Zeev for helping Tesla It was very hard work both couldve just rested on their laurels Much appreciated
Michael Marks then Zeev Drori but I helped out as coCEO as they didnt have much automotive domain expertise
A friend just sent me this excerpt from a Tesla blog I wrote years ago
Liquid nitrogen cryogenic strength test underway
The stars in Starships mirrored hull reflected
Starship 9m test tank made bar at room temp Small leak at a weld doubler Will be repaired retested at cryo
Who is hating on ISRU why Doesnt make sense
If all goes well Falcon will achieve triple digits this year
Parent material strength roughly doubles so weld strength is the only real question mark
Sounds like we need to clear up a few things Tesla wont use this much net water on a daily basis Its possibly a rare peak usage case but not an everyday event Also this is not a natural forest it was planted for use as cardboard only a small part will be used for GF4
First two domes of SN1 are almost complete
Giga Berlin GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability the environment in mind
Tonnage delivered to orbit normalized to LEO would be interesting to see
For sure Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy so net environmental impact will be extremely positive
Going with nomenclature of Giga most widely understood location name vs Giga so Giga Shanghai Giga Nevada Giga New York Giga Berlin

This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank among many other things

It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to strokeaccidentcongenital Dont want to get too excited but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain motor functions There is no other way to do it imo
Ok sure Btw we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world so this shouldnt be thought of as USA only Also work location can be Bay Area preferred but Austin many of our chip designers are there or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory
Desperate times call for desperate measures
First we need to make it super safe easy to use then determine greatest utility vs risk From initially working to volume production implantation is a long road As with vehicle safety it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards
Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year Its awesome
Trollsbots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who arent being paid to push an agenda or scam Google still shows bsscam pages theyre just several clicks away
Report as soon as you see it Trollbot networks on Twitter are a dire problem for adversely affecting public discourse ripping people off Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement
Intuitively that should be straightforward to address but there could be complexities Im unaware of
Yeah it looks like a medieval torture device but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies Not hard to be way better

New emoji Last one comes with free phone hack
Putting that on my LinkedIn for sure
Including hypothesizing that this statement is wrong haha
Youre welcome Was a fun recruiting event Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships
Starlink will be great for any sparsely populated areas with expensive or little to no connectivity
Once upon a time we were all just hydrogen in a vacuum
This isnt quite correct An orbital rocket needs precision thats 3X to 4X better than a water tower so super precise parts fixtures welding are needed Suborbital is much more forgiving
That said although substantial capital engineering is required to achieve extreme precision marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be less than a water tower because its built inside a factory in volume
We saw them a lot launching from Kwajalein in the early days of SpaceX
Fine but that was an easy one
Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets as mass efficiency is critical for the latter but not the former Hopper for example was made of 5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design Optimized skins will be 2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter
No theyre SN1 SN2 to follow shortly Aiming to be a little better each time
Yes were tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering building a heavy duty planisher to flatten cold work the weld area
Anything that doesnt result in a smudgy image on lens cover glass If you get a two part hydrophobic coating probably better just to use first part
Impressive if uncurated There arent many errors Would be interesting to see how GPT would perform with same objective
Ok u can have a little emerald
Hard to believe that is high efficiency solar power seamlessly integrated into beautiful roof tiles Great work by SolarGlass engineering Giga NY factory Tesla installation teams
The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated This is a very important product
This is incorrect No air suspension planned for Y Only SX Cybertruck havewill have air suspension
Your comment above Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after knowing its residual value will be zilch Legacy auto go EV or go BUST is super important for car buyers Residual values for gasdiesel cars will plummet in coming years
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive Its stunning vs a regular roof in person imo Photos dont do it justice
Europe China timing will be announced soon
First two domes in frame are for SN2 third is SN1 thrust dome
Many Bay Area installations are ongoing now
Probably months or so is certainly fine for orbit but SpaceX 30X will be better
Unfortunately Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side but none required on leeward Even windward shielding is very light
Its integrated roof solar so should be light enough for almost any home
Yes but we want to focus on textured black first then move into Earth tones convolutions
No problem Snow ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness so accumulates less than a normal roof Even so its very strong can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles
I think will still be better than a normal roof but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice snow sounds like a good option We have that already on car windows

OpenAI should be more open imo
Reminded me of The Lady of Shalott by Waterhouse
Unfortunately I must agree that these are reasonable concerns
Maybe possible with improved wheelstires which would be available to all previously made cars
Initially yes but then will make sense to localize closer to customers Pretty much same plan as vehicles
All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated including Tesla
Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
Might be used around flap joints
Theres a tough performance vs range tradeoff Plaid has absurd performance while holding range roughly constant
Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
Editing error Meant to say t2E Interesting that monochrome is roughly a millionth of a percent
X will also improve by a similar amount
Direct links arent needed to offer service Starlink will initially bounce signals off groundocean relays to get from to
Thanks to all who caught the error
albedo will drop significantly on almost every successive launch
Regulations require calling it something else so we added
I have no control only very limited insight into OpenAI Confidence in Dario for safety is not high
The joints will have shielding but its hard to ensure a good seal Transpiration cooling or simply higher pressure cold gas flow would purge the area behind the hot gas seal
Depends on when car was built as there are many small hardware improvements so most will be somewhere in between
High bay for stacking Starship engine bay propellant tanks fairing fka nosecone sections is almost done
The Persuader hammer will fix SN1
In the order that they were written
I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up
O2 header tank is tip of nosecone CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
Active ride height active damping are gamechanging for a truck or any car with a high maxmin weight ratio
Btw in some prior tweets Id said production Cybertruck would be wide vs body width at unveil This is slightly too small Will be closer to but come standard with upper laser blade lights
Attach wheels to the landing legs tow Starship to the launch pad
These problems are fundamentally intertwined Building many rockets allows for successive approximation Progress in any given technology is simply of iterations progress between iterations
Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big 2nd hardest is achieving full rapid reuse with payload to orbit of
SN will have better fit weld quality Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings so much less weld length
Yes will also show realtime changes to max acceleration braking cornering speed on gradient range latter factoring in route elevation changes cargo or tow mass drag impact
There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this It will be a lot heavier than steel but not dangerous Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet They were fine
F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk Little change is expected going forward with F9FH or Dragon Starship production thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year
Sorry meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose CH4 main tank is above LOX main
The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach anyway so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
Header tanks are only of main tank volume so not a big deal Pressurized volume is still cubic meters
Its mostly to balance the ship during entry After delivering satellites the front is light back is heavy due to engines landing legs
SN2 tank integration starts this week with much less circumferential pucker Thanks Fronius
Teslas in a tunnel Happening in Vegas rn
I had no idea this existed Sounds awesome though
Testing Raptor in vertical configuration on the giant tripod should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
Full disclosure Im actually a year old vampire Its such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries
Definitely Whats in that sky city thing Needs a prequel even more than a sequel
I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch
Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement
The competitor should be a drone fighter plane thats remote controlled by a human but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy The F would have no chance against it
We had the wrong settings To make the welds super flat strong were building a heavy duty custom planisher but just having the right settings is a major improvement
Mad respect for the makers of things
Bernies tax rate is too high
Sleeving SN2 dome in the high bay
No matter what we need to pressurize the production system Rocket design is relatively easy making one is hard making many is extremely hard Manufacturing is underrated
True Oddly those who complained didnt actually order FSD Perhaps they werent aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery
Theres a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load Dont shuck the puck
Also when tech is new catalog engineering isnt possible as there is no catalog Has to be first principles
Track mode V2 is pretty cool Maybe too complicated to use though Lmk thoughts for improvement
Cool were tracking to release more FSD features later this month
We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code 3D labelling then functionality will happen quickly Not long now
Were stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure first with water then at cryo Hopefully ready to test in a few days
Were making progress Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees Hopefully better in a few months
The coronavirus panic is dumb 5M
Envelope expanded SpaceX Mar Falcon booster has landed on Landing Zone our 50th landing of a rocket booster
Accurate Eric Berger Mar I spent last weekend in Boca Chica Texas visiting SpaceXs manufacturing facilities speaking with Elon Musk I have visited a lot of rocket factories but Ive never seen anything like this Show this thread
Rocket will land in highest winds ever at Cape Canaveral tonight This is intentional envelope expansion
Final Dragon Version mission tonight SpaceX Mar Since its first mission in when it became the first private spacecraft to visit the Dragon has spent over days attached to the orbiting laboratory delivered over pounds of cargo returned over pounds back to Earth
Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date overextrapolating exponential growth which is never what happens in reality Keep extrapolating virus will exceed mass of known universe
Fatality rate also greatly overstated Because there are so few test kits those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19 but those with minor symptoms are usually not Prevalence of coronaviruses other colds in general population is very high
Market was bit high anyway so due for a correction
SN2 with thrust puck passed cryo pressure engine thrust load tests late last night
Recent missed landing at sea was due to incorrect wind data If this land landing fails it will most likely be for a different reason
Static fire short flights with SN3 longer flights with SN4 but spooling up the whole StarshipRaptor production line is really what matters
Ships with a lot of people limited medical facilities are a serious issue
Thanks for taking us through this today Hopefully such horrors will never again be repeated in reality
Coachella should postpone itself until it stops sucking

Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems Ventilators are not difficult but cannot be produced instantly Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now
How does this compare to favipiravir theguardiancom Japanese flu drug clearly effective in treating coronavirus says China Shares in Fujifilm Toyama Chemical which developed favipiravir surged after praise by Chinese official
Sounds good we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
Based on current trends probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
Imo this professor is correct Also growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day despite 10X increase in testing From Tues to today was Track this chart
Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home Elderly should avoid close contact even with family members for now Those seem most important
China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers all of Tesla Shanghai
Yes I received chloroquine via central line through my chest both arms Had near fatal case of falciparum Wouldve died for sure if not for chloroquine Doesnt mean it works for C19 but maybe better than nothing
Yeah There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent but it didnt affect orbit insertion Shows value of having engines Thorough investigation needed before next mission
Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website New confirmed cases not oftreported presumptive positive is trending to level off over next few weeks be negligible by end of April Same pattern as China

I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts sent me to ICU immediately I was hours from being unrecoverable So I take expert advice with a grain of salt
Seems to be happening a lot
Very sensible Knows how to handle exponential functions in reality
Were working on ventilators even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
Kids are essentially immune but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable Family gatherings with close contact between kids grandparents probably most risky
Pretty close Design is evolving rapidly Would be great to flatten domes embed engines add barrel sections of propellant for same total length Also current legs are a bit too small
Last launch aborted due to slightly high power Possibly but not obviously related to today This vehicle has seen a lot of wear so today isnt a big surprise Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions Wont risk nonSpaceX satellites
Whats worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the parasite they still couldnt find it
Whether Zpak works in this situation or not its a kickass med for many maladies enmwikipediaorg Azithromycin Wikipedia
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about stateoftheart ventilators Very impressive team
We have N95 masks getting PAPRs Will have our team reach out
A single computer pump pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care avoid crossflow risk
We expect to have over to distribute this week Getting them delivered installed operating is the harder part
Thanks Tesla China team China Customs Authority LAX customs for acting so swiftly
Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids who have almost no risk of C19 death with grandparents who have high risk especially those with prior lung damage are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
Well try to get deliver as many as possible N95 masks are a pain to wear btw Less onerous masks are better most of the time
Yeah pretty much House could talk to car know when youre expected home so temp humidity would be perfect just as you arrive No wasted energy
Thanks for taking delivery in your garage Let us know if theres anything else you need
This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
Have you seen more data on HCQ ZPak Hard to find
Youre most welcome Were working on getting other types of PPE too Ventilators should arrive within a few days
Sure although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators Just a spike in demand right now Also using CPAP machines for less severe cases using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet shortterm demand
Sure would love to do home hvac thats quiet efficient with humidity control HEPA filter
According to the Italian govt only of deaths are actually due to C19 This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries
Italy On reevaluation by the National Institute of Health only per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus
Could maybe tap the condensation for water too Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure fresh water just dump it on the ground
Sigmoid Scurve is how all physical mental viruses behave regardless of containment Containment reduces asymptote of Scurve At this point we have strict containment in USEurope should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China
Most likely imo we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page
Sigmoidal for China followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
Do you have data on the false positive rate Ive heard a wide range of numbers CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data onset date known presumed positive
Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test so you know if youre immune Refill blood banks give donors peace of mind Eric D Hargan Mar Earlier this week I visited to donate blood for patients who are involved in clinical trials The COVID pandemic has created a blood plasma shortage in America If you are a healthy individual please consider donating blood One donation can save up to lives
Also makes for a great shelter
Can you do a fast antibody test
Youre most welcome Credit to the Tesla team Will do our best to help in any way
We will give away all our ventilators whether we buy them or build them
Stop In the name of love
And many doctors are not treating patients due to fear of giving or receiving C19
Working on that with Medtronic Given NY pressing needs were delivering Resmed Philips Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight
Something weird happened at CDC yesterday They changed the graph to include estimated illness onset date This is a significantly less rigorous standard
C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases excluding NY already
Yes Just as with groceries the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed
Yes Is there more Should be a lot of data by now
We have extra FDAapproved ventilators Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions Device shipping cost are free Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients not stored in a warehouse Please me or know

Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high Isp a little low but over time it will be 150t to LEO fully reusable
Hoping to roll out traffic lights stops to wide US release in a few weeks probably WW release in Q3 so many variations in each country Very important to make sure this is done right
Yeah very important to provide CBiPAP devices to prevent cases from becoming severe Once severe intratracheal intubation survival rates are low
The Scurve appears to be entering the logarithmic phase

It is stable on the ground without propellant loaded which is an improvement from OG Atlas
Probably best to keep control local but easy to check status from afar
Exactly No point in an abort system on Mars so got to make the core ship super safe
Rockets spacecraft have to operate in vacuum so maintaining pressure is fundamental However this can be made very safe over time imo

Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators
Good progress but years to launch our first humans is a long time Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime Eric Berger Apr If SpaceX launches Crew Dragon by June consider its decade Falcon Cargo Dragon debut Dragon docks with ISS Booster land landing Sea landing Booster reuse Falcon Heavy debut Starlink launch Boca Chica expansion Crewed launch
Orbital human spaceflight returns to the Cape in six weeks NASA Apr Before our Apollo astronauts launched to the Moon they had to walk out of these doors at And when we launch on the Demo mission these doors will be used again Prepare to LaunchAmerica on May
It is about too small but lots of fun
Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function The hospitals themselves acknowledged receipt of ventilators
I literally have the receipts This is so dumb
Youre welcome Very exciting times ahead for space
Pretty much although we also sent some Medtronic units which are meant for extreme situations Those require a lot of work to set up operate Should be used sparingly SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system

Its a hard problem mostly due to esthetics but its the future we should have
No as the header tanks are quite small relative to main tons vs tons Only uses very tip of the nose
No oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry

Im dying to do super efficient quiet home HVAC with HEPA water distillation Its weird but I really want to do it
Frankly much of the stimulus money is questionable but this much to oil gas seems especially so
Yes It will even float for a while
Thanks We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle all sats get sunshades starting with launch
Guaranteed to make any party more fun
Pretty much We place high value on simulation too but nothings as weird as reality
Am in Boca working on the rocket with an awesome team so pretty great
Yeah whole lot more Aargh Im dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday
They are in fact being deorbited haha
Numbers I was told from Wuhan were to mortality rate for invasive ventilators Those are not good odds
That is more reasonable especially if mostly loans Oil gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy
When I talked to doctors in Wuhan they recommended against invasive ventilators in favor of noninvasive
Yes same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth Contagion is higher in high pop density cities mortality proportionate to age
New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan bloombergcom New Study Shows Nearly in Covid Patients on Ventilators Dont Make It With no proven drugs ventilators are one of the goto options for ICUs critical care doctors in working with severe cases of Covid pneumonia
Definitely header tanks nosecone on SN5 hopefully flaps too Definitely flaps on SN6
If this launch succeeds we will have put up satellites
Solar panel angle during orbit raise park Were fixing it now
Maybe just make Joe Mode quieter
Small amount of isopropyl alcohol cleaning fluid was trapped in a sensor dead leg ignited in flight

No good chance of RUD rapid unscheduled disassembly event but landing pad is separated from launch pad
Haha true Great headline Its quite hard to have rocket test articles not explode as they so desperately want to
Yes switching soon to a series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp is good as sheet but not as plate Also a lot of geometric changes
What do you make of the FT claims John BurnMurdoch Apr NEW a lot of data on reported Covid deaths is highly suspect so weve been looking into excess mortality how many more people than usual have been dying around the world in recent weeks Story by me free to read Show this thread
These wont be strictly coupled to ship serial number Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder
As usual for most things building production system for Raptor is harder than designing it
How is it considered probable if theres no covid test Is just a cough or high temperature enough
Successive iteration of both design manufacturing Latter is harder than former
Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time reduce pucker Those are still working their way through production

Franz I do have absurdly similar tastes
Yes converts CO2 H2O to CH4 O2 Perfect for Mars enmwikipediaorg Sabatier reaction Wikipedia
Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
Starship Super Heavy propellant mass is tons O2 CH4 I think we can get propellant cost down to ton in volume so flight With high flight rate probably below 5M fully burdened cost for tons to orbit or kg
A fully rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost unless using a foolish propellant Same principle as cars planes boats etc
In this case just chilling the gas back to liquid
No they will be smashed beyond repair corroded
Yeah although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
Yes mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars best case
Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching
Probably makes sense to have a Details section of the app that mirrors everything in the car Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason
Thats harder than it sounds Will check with team

Yes this is a high priority
Looks about right Ice miningrefining on Mars maximizing total system efficiency will be hard CO2 is easy as Mars atmosphere is mostly that Also has good amount of N2 which is important for life
No but its mostly the same as the ship except for the thrust bulkhead engines vs
Thats pretty much what happened The cows werent sure what to do not having encountered a rocket before so first ran one direction then the other
It will only work for higher latitudes Seattle at first then get progressively closer to the equator

Yes California approved but an unelected county official illegally overrode Also all other auto companies in US are approved to resume Only Tesla has been singled out This is super messed up
Those who always disagree have a closed mind but by their very nature that wont sink in sigh

Outcomebased contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than costplus especially if solesourced as the former rewards results latter rewards waste Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government The difference in results will be incredible
Actually were on SN30 for Raptor
Quite a piece I should credit SovietRussian engine work in the s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4 They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands with Isp up to secs
Were working on new legs Wider stance able to autolevel Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky pitted surfaces
Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2 use of common dome CH4 O2 liquid at similar temps higher TW of engines enables de facto higher deltaV than an H2O2 stage
Exactly Chartering a dedicated flight around the world costs less than buying a small single engine turboprop plane In the same way a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once
I got the fuel cell question about times
the laser beam long exposure shots
Also insulation of a deep cryogen which Id call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka of air is heavy prone to heat leaks H2 is hell
We could never reach Isp with RPkerosene CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper but even better in practice With CH4 you can reach of max theoretical combustion efficiency but RP is on a good day requires desooting of turbines between flights
Important technical note due to higher OF of CH4 vs RP1 oxygen is dense significant density increase of subcooled CH4 plus no common dome insulation needed plus cryo strength bump of CH4 tank mass of CH4O2 stage is almost same as RP1O2
Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily this is by far the hardest problem mass down thrust up Isp up Current improvement list continues past SN50 As the saying goes its inspiration perspiration
Maybe I should retweet the top four or five point What caught your eye the most

Not sure Theyre pretty close together
Directionally correct but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system doesnt come back land
Thats the goal There a few known weak points on this test tank probably capable of more pressure The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points
We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas The launch landing are not subtle But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat
US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology
Around 20ms Its designed to run realtime competitive video games Version which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency
Actually weve made slight changes but the range improvement is efficiency
Yeah Merlin using a single pintle injector with cold liquid propellant needs a longer chamber than Raptor which uses a large number of coaxial injectors despite Merlin being less than half thrust Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas thats already mixed
Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox fuel preburners The lower limit of thrust is ox fuel turbopump injector preburner stiffness essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out
We must pass The Great Filter

Ive been working in Boca since Sunday August heat humidity in South Texas is intense If you think of it like a tropical resort that makes it better though
I dont want be cavalier but there isnt an obvious limit flights are possible Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded Cleaning all Merlin turbines is difficult Raptor is way easier in this regard despite being a far more complex engine
Its counterintuitive but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid high density propellant pumpfed light tanks that it beats hot gas for the flip That said hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers stabilizing ship if landing in high winds

Starship propellant is oxygen so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough Otherwise we could bruteforce it with tankers to low Earth orbit Thats probably faster
Very different computers are needed for training vs inference FSD is mostly Int8 but Dojo is de facto FP32 feels like FP32 but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated so we dont need to rewrite all the training software It should work almost immediately

Thats the number that really matters
Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles
Just a guess but probably mid teens Booster stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors Well build several ships just to improve the production system
Exactly Problems like that have been addressed
All frames stitched to single frame tricky as all cameras overlap in different ways then creating video segments for labeling training Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten

Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
Current was too strong for droneship to hold station Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions

For Dojo were betting on FP16 with floating floating point essentially truncating mostly zeroes so it feels like FP32 existing software just works We considered FP8 for a while but everyone hated it I even asked Twitter For inference int8 works great
Shaped like a diamond aligned on true north
It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX Tesla success probabilities above zero
You really want waypoints this much
No but you make some great points Important to note that irons cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel That said iron alleviates much of the scaling problem
Yeah we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
Implicit conflation of consumption capital allocation is the foundational error
Dojo uses our own chips a computer architecture optimized for neural net training not a GPU cluster Could be wrong but I think it will be best in world

Something appealing about HawkingHartle idea but I agree with TurokFeldbruggeLehners
Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times
Yeah but might not need it
Most likely all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability change in wind direction in which case one or more flaps will extend
There are some practical size constraints too Cant be too big to fit in the engine compartment But it could be a little bigger sec Isp would be nice
Doesnt seem to be a problem We could probably increase area ratio given bar max demonstrated chamber pressure

Turns out they mostly press the letter s on the typewriter theguardiancom Give six monkeys a computer what do you get Certainly not the Bard It is a favourite question of pub philosophers everywhere If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters would they eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare
We will probably IPO Starlink but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth predictable Public market does not like erratic cash flow haha Im a huge fan of small retail investors Will make sure they get top priority You can hold me to it
We just need enough height to test body flaps drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks Will do several flights to confirm working well then add heat shield go high Mach
Glad SpaceX could help We are prioritizing emergency responders locations with no Internet connectivity at all
Seven years for sure to 30M new fully electric vehicles per year six years maybe Five years is possible but unlikely An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials

We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing launches next year
Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
Vectorspace birds eye view coming with FSD
Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while its driving
Pretty wild considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public years ago
This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of or more presently 10X longterm
Oh yeah Starship update coming in about weeks The design has coalesced What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1 with almost no changes
Glad to hear your Mom is ok
Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
All of that more Were doing a broad review of launch site propulsion structures avionics range regulatory constraints this weekend I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person
Good to see Inspiring for future of space
Great render The circumferential welds skin panels will be much smoother in future builds
The remake has the potential to be great I kinda liked the original tbh but its possible to take it up a level
Yes Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
The ship rings are thicker than they need to be for now so same thickness works for booster ship for hoop stress Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling
Great letter It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites as were actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine scientific progress is not impeded
Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
Its cool for sure can should be done but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind solar aka big fusion reactor in sky
Average latency will improve as more satellites launch directly above you more frequently more ground stations are deployed As were able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers legacy Internet latency will be zero
High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
Probably or with an optimized tanker although filling up the ship in orbit isnt required for Mars so is possible
One of my favorite writers Foundation is tough to make into a movie but has outstanding potential
Brownsville is quite far south so probably months or so for good connectivity needs several more Starlink launches Im using it at the little house I rent in the area Definitely not good there yet
Thats very hard to do Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open Its designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic
I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica
Waymo is impressive but a highly specialized solution The Tesla approach is a general solution The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives Will release limited beta in a few weeks
Great work by SpaceX valve engineering production
Yes failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake happened in most countries Herd immunity for vast majority of people quarantine vulnerable was right though imo
Yes we will play sexy snake jazz
Im proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation Its already sensible for rocket engine parts To the best of our knowledge SpaceX is or years ahead of other companies in use of additive
Compilers need to improve imo Most type pointer or other memory problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user
Autopilot team is making great progress Reality sure is complicated
Pretty much but I think it may end on a high note
But now we understand production much better It will be our primary competitive advantage longterm
Yeah its not a contest Advanced casting crushes bestcase 3D printing but casting doesnt work well for complex enclosed volumes high strength or high temp alloys
Even GM Chrysler went bankrupt in Ford Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy
Great render Note there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand ship to booster
We just completed a financing round but will let you know when there is another one
We do have giant steel balls haha
Yes the Gigafactory is the hardest most critical product
Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release Wont need to wait for FSD
The Model production ramp was sheer agony for two years but that was do or die for Tesla No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in years Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three
High bay should be finished except for the giant gantry crane within a few weeks Super Heavy stacking should begin around then
Bringing a new product to volume production is inspiration perspiration You do still need that critical seed of inspiration but its fun takes people Production takes people hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly
Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca but this could turn out to be a mistake
There are sensitive elements but theyre on the inside Also a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what Ive posted And yeah anyone who can reverse engineer what Ive posted doesnt need to reverse engineer
Exactly We barked up that tree for way too long sigh Gives a false sense of victory being close a tantalizing local maximum but reality is just too messy weird Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once
Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal
That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors but none of those companies have made one
Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper lower face sheets eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity improved polar moment or inertia This is a major breakthrough
Yeah provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
Yeah we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as
It might be used in some areas ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions
The crash absorption rails can be cut off replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
I definitely need to try these tasty cakes pastries on my next visit

This graph appears to be upside down
Starting production on seater next month initial deliveries early December
I dont think this is accurate
Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week as promised This will at first be limited to a small number of people who are expert careful drivers
With FSD we got stuck in a lot of local maximums which wasnt clear until we hit the ceiling This time its right
Even if half that amount its still a big deal
Yes Everything is slow to a phased array antenna
Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate Almost every element of production is automated Only wire harnesses general assembly which are of production costs are primarily manual
Good grief SpaceX is getting zero money for this Starship is designed to carry people cargo around Earth also to moon Mars Vast majority of use will be civilian Its just like an airline in space All airlines sometimes carry military cargo but is civilian
Tesla FSD computers dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes they each run different neural nets so we do get full use of TOPS but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC or engine in this analogy fails
Or maybe weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom
Will release order configurator probably in Jan
Thank you much more accurate haha
At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time
Accurate analysis Quite a few egointelligence people in your comment thread haha Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia which are certainly good companies could meet any of our capability schedule cost or power requirements
We simplified this a lot Its basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point which is way more profound than it sounds
More great renderings Significant improvements coming to the welds
Yeah there are literally more cameras than years ago but still zero clear photos
Also system should autodelete old data automatically by default
Its still there but focus is Vegas Prufrock our new tunneling machine
Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction but hes in a tough position with so many constituencies to please No way to make everyone happy
Maybe a month or so Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations
The SoCs sync with each other to timessec exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony like a symphony so its fairly obvious when one is discordant
I have Goosebumps merch Not sure how tbh
FSD beta rollout happening tonight Will be extremely slow cautious as it should
Data from engine Starship static fire this morning looks good Proceeding with nosecone mate
That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts million tons of mass into energy every second We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization
Wow that would be quite a trip
London to Beijing would be cool
Pretty accurate Its not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNARNA to fix bugs in our code inform immune system what to attack
Doesnt seem to be any life in this solar system Maybe under the ice of Europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of Mars Worth reading enmwikipediaorg Drake equation Wikipedia
Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description but yes
MobiC has too much mobility fusion has too little We need MobiD haha

Starship nosecone high bay tiki bar
Congratulations SpaceX Team SpaceX Oct successful flights
Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release FSD price new or upgrade will go up by on Monday
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week Applies only to US for now One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year
Not intentional We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada a single state Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl table salt
I mean ya gotta have a tiki bar
Just a smallseeming issue with loss of upper stage camera Probably nothing serious but standing down to reexamine whole vehicle just in case
Cold gas for now hot later
There will be a deg glass Star Bar name tbd at top of high bay
After it gets to orbit a few times
Video training inference is essential for excellent autonomy
Working on it Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command
Yes very helpful Thanks all beta testers
Visualization will tone down significantly for production These are intentionally strident colors
Yup With beta updates therell be a lot of steps fwd step back situations but pace of improvement will be extremely fast
Those engines could go bar but would be dicey Pushing it for nearterm tests doesnt achieve anything but Im confident Raptor will do bar for orbital flights
Raptor has now run for secs at bar chamber pressure before encountering issues mTF sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes RBoost variant is aiming for ton thrust at bar with same nozzle exit area Will need bigger pumps
Well we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves How much time do you think we should give
Great pics That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful
Sure it could be an option in settings
Good point Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website
Im in Boca every week so maybe we could talk then Given that Starship is not exactly subtle this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see
As soon as we complete testing regulators approve So many different traffic signs rules languages around world not to mention driving on left side of road Also a long challenging road lies ahead getting to high s reliability way beyond human

Tesla team has done great work
Same bot just change setting to combat
And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GMToyota left They took all good equipment sold most of rest for scrap It looked apocalyptic inside
Well tbh our capex efficiency in was trash
Little crane Am I just a toy to you
Some challenges with high winds Looks like Sunday for static fire
One of the best games ever
All that was left were broken bots equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value But we scrounged up spare parts fixed the trusty old bots brought the factory back to life
Well being a phased array antenna it is actually rather flat
FEAR with modern graphics sound would rock
To the best of my knowledge literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades Most of the factory had no equipment at all Even light bulbs were missing in some areas GM Toyota took everything that worked moved it to their other factories
Max Payne was great on many levels Silent Hill good too

And Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct
That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in Last hour of last day possible as investors were leaving town that night we were days away from bankruptcy I put in all money I had didnt own a house had to borrow money from friends to pay rent Difficult time
Sure although it might be quite a short livestream Lot can go wrong but well provide video warts all You will see every frame that we do
New design is better with many minor tweaks Even the small details matter
Tesla Texas team is making great progress Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker
Sure maybe in a month or so
This build should be noticeably better with interventions
Lower latitude states need more satellites in position so probably January
Einstein was great but did not succeed at engineering he tried
Thanks to a great AutopilotAI team working super hard Doing neural nets without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what theyre doing Reality is the hardest sim
As soon as we get country approval This is required for each country individually as no EUwide approval system exists Probably start receiving final there are many steps approvals around FebMarch
I put in my last money even though I thought we would still fail But it was either that or certain death for Tesla Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup considered super quirky back then while stalwarts like GM Chrysler were going bankrupt
Ive spent more than half my life in California love the state But frankly I think CA has the winningfortoolong problem Like a sports team with many championships it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency a sense of entitlement
Weve tested a subscale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability so it will probably work at scale but reality tends to bite you on the ass
I could not be more excited about the new supercollider That said while it is considerably larger I dont think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering
Canada Norway are next after we get US out of early beta
True Also fewer heart attacks as way easier to pump blood in gravity
Stable controlled descent with body flaps would be great Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks relight would be a major win
Didnt realize that was possible No problem if theres a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe
Yes although I didnt expect the stock to rise so much so soon The reason for the stock options is that theyre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in to years
Super appreciate your support Steve That convertible loan gave us months of runway Fortunately Daimler invested 50M in May months later
Yeah Although if it fails right at the end some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater
Faults will never be zero but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
We measure this primarily in intervention probability This update addressed several issues resulting in perhaps fewer interventions Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments True for most beta releases in my experience
Closest we got was about a month The Model ramp was extreme stress pain for a long time from mid to mid Production logistics hell
Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch yaw roll during descent such that the ship is positioned well to relight flip land would be a big win
Now were talking Also Stephenson is in the constellation Scrotum haha

China understands the profound importance of reusability The era of expendable rockets will soon be over
Good explanation 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects especially in large intersections with dense vehicle pedestrian traffic Frame rate latency from frame to wheel vector change also important
Neuralink wont overclock the brain it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input output especially latter
Thanks to a lot of great AutopilotAI hardware software engineers at Tesla
Version is about a year away
It would appear that their calculations were incorrect
I do expect this to become an important product for the world but probably not financially material for Tesla
Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines cures CureVac has version in use Version is under development
We rewrote all labeling software for 4D Very different from labeling single photos Dojo wont contribute for about a year Its mostly a generalized NN training computer but benchmark were tracking is framessecond Must beat next gen GPUTPU clusters or its pointless
Am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs Will require extreme precision
Faraday invented the electric motor Tesla the commutatorfree threephase AC induction motor in other words a useful electric motor
Maxwell was amazing Should have more recognition Tesla Motors Inc was almost called Faraday as it took until late to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since
Chip has temp sensor automatically maintains safe temp
Theres no entrybraking burn hypersonic angle of attack is degrees
Enough already on my plate Teslas Maybe one day will do a prototype Those are relatively easy Volume production with high reliability low cost passing all regulations is 100X harder
Something extremely bogus is going on Was tested for covid four times today Two tests came back negative two came back positive Same machine same test same nurse Rapid antigen test from BD
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection N1 N3 genes below cycles is reliable above cycles is not
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry Whats the approximate false positive rate all things considered for cov2 PCR tests
Symptoms of a typical cold Nothing unusual so far
If its happening to me its happening to Im getting PCR tests from separate labs Results will take about hours
Technically I tested positive then negative twice then positive again so Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid is an equally correct title The rapid antigen test from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin
Just a scratch We can buff it out
A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too Hard to get a straight answer False positives will roughly scale with of tests daily test rate has gone ballistic
Am getting wildly different results from different labs but most likely I have a moderate case of covid My symptoms are that of a minor cold which is no surprise since a coronavirus is a type of cold
Big expansion of beta program in to weeks
Cool but please be super cautious Expect two steps forward one back Lot of new code was merged
Burst disk worked so vehicle appears to be ok Well have to swap out at least one of the engines
We lost vehicle pneumatics Reason unknown at present Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure otherwise its going to pop the cork
Cold symptoms are gone for now
The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load From what I can gather youre probably not infectious above you probably are below Sound about right
Fwiw lab I just spoke to thinks below is accurate to gets dicey above is bs Will talk to several more labs There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere
Mild sniffles cough slight fever past few days Right now no symptoms although I did take NyQuil
Moreover lower the true prevalence the higher the false positive number will be This sounds obvious but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low
Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss We need to design out this problem
Just spoke directly to a testing lab Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene unique to cov2 N3 is also sought but is generic to other sars viruses High PCR cycle count does give false positives but they believe accuracy is good below cycles cycles is their max
Interesting My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene unique to cov2 showing at cycle N3 generic sars at I get results of todays test tomorrow Almost no symptoms today so hopefully better results
Note this is not the spike protein They dont consider that reliable
This a great reference Worth a read

Let the Martians decide their own future
Wise words from Bogle The point of companies is products services They have no point in of themselves nor do these indices Buy hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap sell where you dont
So many things you want some you didnt know you wanted
We should just count the atoms at this point
There is such a thing as too much sentience
I was going to say Sim but that seemed too obvious haha
Safety is our primary design goal
Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime However we can establish a human base there in our lifetime At least a future spacefaring civilization discovering our ruins will be impressed humans got that far
Next weeks release is special Lot of fundamental improvements both important bug fixes entire new areas of functionality
If next weeks release looks good we will widen beta
Its designed to make life multiplanetary otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than times all current Earth rockets combined including Falcon Necessary for a city on Mars
Haha sexy cropping champion of all time
The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they sometimes dont blow up The amount of power going through them boggles the mind
And cases with high noninfectious Ct should quarantine for a few days while getting another test Second test determines whether theyre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards where viral fragments exist but person is not infectious
Unfortunately there are too many rules around liquor distribution even in the US However we will be selling the lightning bottle shot glasses worldwide
Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields adding watercooled steel pipes to test pad
Yeah looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than 1M for more than tons to orbit so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
Merlin is a strong local maximum design but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what you do What matters is cost per ton to Mars CH4 is the only choice imo Important O2CH4 allows OF ratio of vs for kerosene so of propellant is oxygen
About secs after starting engines martyte covering concrete below shattered sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay One rock blade severed avionics cable causing bad shutdown of Raptor
A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units
Maybe making some notable changes Will wait until figurative literal dust settles
Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh Nothing worked well some parts didnt work at all years later thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine
More like he gave it his blessing It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London
Pretty close Definitely feel if I take DayQuil Frankly this was one of the mildest coldflu experiences Ive ever had
Yes but from a visiting American Ah the irony is just too much
No just a mild cold Same with my bro Def had cov2 though Pc means viral load of million per mL
Absolutely Productiontesting of rocket engines is over of the problem This is true in general For cars production is over of the problem That inspiration is very important but its less than of the pain
Yeah PCR Ct was unequivocal at Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold

Fate loves irony but hates hypocrisy
Now this is what youd call pointy
To be clear this was just an XPeng problem Other companies in China have not done this
Maybe start on that a year from now Depends on how Starship progress goes
We have quiet a queue of products to build Better do new Roadster at some point
Because I am not an investor Tesla is definitely not the only good company but investing is not what I do But I always put my own money into companies I help create otherwise itd be wrong to ask to do so
Were still far from simply video in control out The biggest gamechanger currently underway at Tesla is degree high fps video for labeling training inference
This is a misperception SpaceX developed continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with Just pointless imo for selfdriving If youre going to do active photon generation use an occlusion penetrating wavelength like precision radar at 4mm
It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
I cant comment on turbopump internal details but youre roughly in the ballpark Wow rocket turbopumps especially if oxygenrich are insanely hard Arguably the hardest mechanicalfluidscombustion problem known to exist
Andrej is awesome but it should be said that we have a very talented AutopilotAI team at Tesla Too much credit comes to me Andrej
Not bad We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull
Reality looks like a strange ghostworld at radar wavelengths Almost everything except metal is translucent
Actually off to the side so it doesnt take out the launch mount in bad landing but with the same arm used to pick up the ship

Probably going to a wider beta in weeks
This is a subject of much debate
Starship legs are one of the hardest problems Externally mounted legs require shielding which adds mass Wider stance adds mass Shock absorbers add mass That said we need better legs
Yes very sad news Tony was great
For a second there I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha
Many small improvements but overall similar Wiring is more robust engines are more mature nosecone is sealed better etc
fp16 with least important digits truncated so it feels like fp32 is what were betting on for training with Dojo
Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
Static fire is not risky from build site but we need to clear the build site for early flights

It will get absurdly good Tesla AIAutopilot engineering is awesome Theres some great AI out there but can it selfdrive while playing Cyberpunk
But it is visually stunning playability is good
Far from fully loaded but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy highfar with three engines
The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit As we hit min throttle point an engine would shut off
A tshirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesnt make sense in the absence of magic Also wish there werent levelbased item limits in a singleplayer game
Original Deus Ex was incredible Human Revolution was also great
He was indeed quite grumpy but we did not actually know what we were doing so he had a point
Perhaps slightly more confident but its essential to view this as output vs time As with all manufacturing especially new technology output will follow an Scurve Very slow at first but increasing exponentially then linear then logarithmic
Its a good to great game imo but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
i love all u crazy ppl out there
Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money

Strange if true Tesla already uses ironphosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory A monocell is electrochemically impossible as max voltage is 100X too low Maybe they meant cells bonded together like our structural battery pack
Yup were just ironing out a few bugs

Its one or if you dont have a car with pedestrian speaker We couldnt get everything done in time but more stuff coming
Its a step in that direction
Absolutely Will be text visualization but could add voice too
Unfortunately pedestrian speaker is needed otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn
We will offer multiple display options
Falcon was of successful orbital launches in but maybe a majority of payload to orbit Anyone done the math
Roughly of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique not in any other product Unfortunately since we started out with the dumb in retrospect goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric we ended up with a too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus
You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it
A few more revisions needed Probably Beta or
There are subtle important differences between US Canada traffic rules but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon

Tesla Full SelfDriving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year of that I am confident Cant speak for regulators though
Tesla is responsible for of all the personal professional pain in my life combined But it was worth it
Were going to try to catch the Super Heavy Booster with the launch tower arm using the grid fins to take the load
Might be a few lumps along the way
This is very sensible Opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress everywhere
Seems odd that the opposition group is from BMWs home state of Baveria Thats very far from Brandenburg where Tesla is building the Gigafactory And why would a group that claims to be proenvironment oppose a sustainable energy factory Arent there more important issues

Hey you Yeah you Queen Youre gonna make it
My yearold son Saxon said he feels like will be a good year I agree Let us all make it so

They are part of the solution but require lots of fresh water land We may need something thats ultralarge scale industrial in to years For now by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy
Its a good path for fully renewable rocket energy so solves part of problem but longer chain hydrocarbons than CH4 are needed to be solid at room temp
That would probably mean civilization is doing great although depends on assumptions for inflation haha
Were switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major minor updates Current build is FSD It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA back last night with no interventions

So its finally come to this
No highs no lows only Doge
It was foolish of us not to start engines immediately shut down as are needed to land
Extremely misleading image as doesnt reflect true time cost to people or rain pain
Havent heard that name in years
Not that easy This is two decades of intense work Have to look at old notes emails texts
Yeah By default engine with least lever arm would shut down if all are good
That said the ship landing burn has a clear solution My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid full reusability without which we shall forever be confined to Earth
Yes but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk so landing on engines means high thrustweight further away from hover point which is also risky
Intuitively it would seem so but turbopumpfed Raptors have much higher thrust propellant mass fraction than pressurefed gas thrusters theyre already there
Will still use hot gas maneuvering RCS thrusters as 5X more efficient than nitrogen sec vs sec Isp

Doge appears to be inflationary but is not meaningfully so fixed of coins per unit time whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster

To be clear I am not an investor I am an engineer I dont even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla However when fiat currency has negative real interest only a fool wouldnt look elsewhere Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money The key word is almost
Teslas action is not directly reflective of my opinion Having some Bitcoin which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash is adventurous enough for an SP500 company
The Tesla Solar Roof is slightly hydrophobic so water snow or ice slide off easily

We have too much product complexity already
Most of Earth by end of year all by next year then its about densifying coverage Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas
It is still available off menu but I dont think the range in many drive conditions yet meets the Tesla standard of excellence
Out on launch pad engine swap underway
I hope we dont go bankrupt building them
I hope they do It would be awesome
This is not about winning anyone over We are productionlimited The reason we are making our own cells is to supplement max production of suppliers Even moving at full speed they cannot build enough cells
Probably mid year but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served Bay usually has great Internet

Looks familiar haha Nonetheless the right move Congrats to Rocket Lab
SpaceX team is doing great work One day the true measure of success will be that Starship flights are commonplace
Note buying FSD will still be a better longterm deal than subscription
An area much larger than Boca Chica
First Ive heard of this Well fix the situation Im a fan of video
FSD beta build V8 normally drives me around with no interventions Next version is a big step change beyond that Tesla is solving a major part of realworld AI This is not widely known
There was still a surprisingly high usage of horses in but the trend was obvious
Sounds about right but we want to be very careful with this transition period
Yes beta will be offered much more widely when version is done hopefully next month
Ok lets figure this out tomorrow Im all for exciting video coverage but we also cant have the place festooned with cameras
Great band too bad they broke up
If you want the Tesla Full SelfDriving Beta downloaded to your car let us know Doubling beta program size now with probably 10X size with Still be careful but its getting mature
SN10 is in Valhalla now youtubecom Starship SN10 landing explosion slowmotion Join the Starship film community on discord our new series The Road to Mars

Delamain AI cabs should be able to drive themselves when youre in them be electric by
Tesla AI both hardware software is deeply underestimated
Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink as our terminal is much too big This is for aircraft ships large trucks RVs
Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present hence hard touchdown Weve never seen this before Next time min two engines all the way to the ground restart engine if engine or have issues
SN10 engine was low on thrust due probably to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank Impact of 10ms crushed legs part of skirt Multiple fixes in work for SN11
The is mostly good imo UBI lite as the people get to choose how the money is spent but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole though it is obviously characterized otherwise
Update probably in Q2 Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas so focus right now is on getting that beast built
Fair point If autogenous pressurization had been used CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh which happened in prior flight My fault for approving Sounded good at the time
Its all hot air in the end haha
Beta V8 has literally improvements Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks
Build of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week so thats roughly when download button should show up
Assuming user approves warning agrees to drive carefully it will download latest QAtested FSD Beta build as soon as car connects to wifi
Should be very soon Many subtle differences between US Canada roads so harder than it seems
Still many fine details to address but the final product will be fantastic Theres nothing else even close
The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 cars should all have FSD computers whether or not ordered as an option

This is an opportunity for RH to outdo CB
For sure wise for elderly or immunocompromised to take the vaccine Some debate about the second jab though Quite a few negative reactions to that
If manifest is met SpaceX will do of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year Even so Starships will take years to build a selfsustaining city on Mars
There were baffles but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquidgas level Something similar happened on an early Falcon flight resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff
Might just catch the ship with the launch tower same as booster
Fuel cells should be called fool sells Such a silly choice for cars Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo but at least not absurd
Yeah we talked about that internally Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle Lacks dignity but would work But optimized landing propellant is only of dry mass so its not a gamechanger

SpaceX did 2X rest of world payload to orbit last year probably 3X to 4X this year
Yes Booster is a production pathfinder figuring out how to build transport meter tall stage Booster will fly
The high bay is measured to fit
As you can see I have a long history with using tents
We will need launch tower for that Hook height for the lift is m both booster ship need to be stabilized at stage separation joint

Given significant architectural changes including fundamental improvements to pure vision there is limited value to testing x Hoping to upload V9 button next month
An orbital propellant depot optimized for cryogenic storage probably makes sense longterm
Going well Lot of work for an extra secs of Isp
Not quite how I would tell the story but its probably worth a read

Shame on you Onion This is why people are switching to
I think there is a chance Tesla could be the biggest company

We should be laughing our asses off if its so damn smart
I wanna know when AI will be able to do standup comedy well
You raise a good point haha
Heavy comes in more like a javelin Similar to Falcon but caught by the tower vs landing on legs
My father his extended family have been dependent on financial support from my brother me for over years This article is actually accurate Jeremy Arnold Mar Everyone has a take on Mine is that he deserves a fair shake No more no less Wherever you see him on the herovillain spectrum I encourage you to read this sit with the implications

SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days It has hundreds of design improvements across structures avionicssoftware engine Hopefully one of those improvements covers this problem If not then retrofit will add a few more days
Barely a scratch Back on the stand soon Will report conclusions as soon as we know them
Next major technology rev is at SN20 Those ships will be orbitcapable with heat shield stage separation system Ascent success probability is high However SN20 vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach entry heating land intact
Agreed Were not super far as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all windpower which will be used for LOX of propellant massN2argon distillation Were also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW paired with Tesla Megapacks for continuous power
BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder so will be scrapped We learned a lot but have already changed design to BN2 Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April It might even be orbitcapable if we are lucky

Coming soon Crazy number of launches this year
A tidal wave of vaccine is being produced
Load points just below the grid fins
For practical purposes there is no limit It will just get increasingly difficult to service
I recommend propulsive landing as that is extensible to planets moons asteroids Wings runways are limited to Earth
Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal glide with no landing burn although that is quite a challenge for the tower Next best is catching with tower with emergency pad landing mode on skirt no legs
Shock absorption is built into tower arms Since tower is ground side it can use a lot more mass to arrest booster downward momentum

Congrats to NIO That is a tough milestone
Due to lower gravity you can travel from surface of Mars to surface of Earth fairly easily with a single stage rocket Earth to Mars is vastly harder
For now Costs are decreasing rapidly
Turns out love video games snacks just like us
Almost ready with FSD Beta V9 Step change improvement is massive especially for weird corner cases bad weather Pure vision no radar
Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through but usually insurance companies make you go their approved collision repair partners Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing
That rocket is a hardcore veteran of many missions
Actually happened to me in Cyberpunk haha
When radar vision disagree which one do you believe Vision has much more precision so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion
Comes with wireless charging baseball cap
Absolutely doable Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version highly likely by version
If you dont say anything engage Autopilot it will soon guess based on time of day taking you home or to work or to whats on your calendar
Sensors are a bitstream cameras have several orders of magnitude more bitssec than radar or lidar Radar must meaningfully increase signalnoise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it As vision processing gets better it just leaves radar far behind
These things are best thought of as probabilities There are forwardfacing cameras It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead
Good point Next major software rev will do much better with automating wipers seat heating defrost Probable seat settings just based on occupant mass distribution should be possible
If we make life multiplanetary there may come a day when some plants animals die out on Earth but are still alive on Mars

Doge Barking at the Moon Miro
Maybe its about how you use it
This is accurate Service uptime bandwidth latency are improving rapidly Probably out of beta this summer
Great review Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field Shortterm goal is addressing brain spine problems Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human machine intelligence
Limited production of Model Y this year high volume next year
Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week Beta button hopefully next month This is a march of s trying to get probability of no injury above of miles for city driving Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving
Passive Autopilot sometimes called active safety comes standard on all Teslas
Essentially passive Autopilot car intervenes only when crash probability is high cuts crashes in half Active Autopilot car is driving itself cuts crashes in half again Doesnt mean there are no crashes but on balance Autopilot is unequivocally safer
Button timing of May is aspirational Depends on how well limited beta of V9 goes but I would be surprised if wide beta aka button is later than June FSD subscription next month is a sure thing

NASA Rules SpaceX Apr NASA has selected Starship to land the first astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo program We are humbled to help usher in a new era of human space exploration

Astronauts preparing to launch to NASA Apr A look inside the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour spacecraft during commmunications checks LR
This is the essence of my philosophy
Powerwall peak steady power capability is better than advertised Now that we have lots of operational data Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month Depending on production date power increase power may be at 30C ambient temp
Sandy Munro knows what hes talking about
I could get a job just not at an Internet company werent many back then
Your research as a private individual is better than professionals Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled this car did not purchase FSD Moreover standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on which this street did not have
Support for humanitys future in space is super appreciated Lets make the scifi future we want real
New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space
Very important Most people dont know this Wind is also super cheap especially when paired with batteries
Im staying at a friends place in Florida that is powered by Tesla Solar Roof Powerwall When grid power goes down airconditioning automatically turns off in some of the house Computers lights dont even flicker Owner says he doesnt notice
Did you buy a Powerwall Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid but usually not if stored in our battery This also enables electricity security for your home Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full can stabilize grid
If Tesla owners are conspiracy theorists then it would be fair to call them advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers If thats an unfair criticism a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers Tesla is of deaths
Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp In house power vernacular this translates to 80LRA soft start of ton HVAC Two Powerwalls would double this three would triple etc

Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in possibly total units in
True The opposite in fact I provide financial support to my parents
Yeah roughly 200MWkm using currently available solar panels Whats really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks
An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical mechanical engineer so I was taught a lot engineering without appreciating it at the time
FCC is fair sensible NHTSA FAA too of the time I agree with regulators On rare occasions we disagree This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didnt anticipate
I find it more helpful to readfollow individual journalists rather than publications Any given publication is going to have wide range of views albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative perhaps reflecting innate human biases Citizen journalism FTW

I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible
Gating factor is achieving proving higher safety with pure vision than with visionradar We are almost there FSD Beta V9 will blow your mind
Rawlinson was never chief engineer He arrived after Model S prototype was made left before things got tough was only ever responsible for body engineering not powertrain battery software production or design
Probably a few months There are many subtle differences between US Canada driving
Hopefully later this year for several more states Insurance is different for almost every state in America regulatory approvals take time
True Anyone paying attention to the rate of improvement will realize that Tesla AutopilotFSD is already superhuman for highway driving swiftly getting there for city streets

Do you want Tesla to accept Doge Yes No votes Final results
It is high time there was a carbon tax
Subscription rolls out in about a month
We had to focus on removing radar confirming safety That release goes out next week to US production Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD v9 beta will release Difference between v8 v9 is gigantic
Locating ground stations at data centers will significantly improve latency jitter Data can go from user terminal to server without touching the Internet
I have a lot of respect for anyone who ships useful product at scale It is insanely hard work
End of year along with FSD provided we get regulatory approval Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD
I think were maybe a month or two away from wide beta But these things are hard to predict accurately The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD so much more progress has been made than it would seem

Now that I have made some improvements Im pretty sure its worth haha
Yeah sold my houses except for in Bay Area thats rented out for events Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX Also AI risk mitigation with Neuralink fixing traffic with Boring

The Plaid carbonwrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere We have to keep some secrets We have a few ideas for increasing torque max rpm even further for new Roadster Definitely fun exciting engineering ahead
It is an honor to work with such talented engineers
Maybe we should advertise informationally just so people know stuff like this exists
True we somewhat overcompensated on Bluetooth antenna capability haha Will work on turning it down near your destination
Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator
The aliens would say So Long Thanks for the Orifice
Pretty much an average day back then
Decided to sell my last remaining house Just needs to go to a large family who will live there Its a special place
Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal usually high strength steel Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM as carbon sleeve mostly stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration
Most people have no idea just how good the Tesla air purification system is Literally 10X better than any other car
Oh man home hvac that is super energy efficient quiet purifies the air would be great We developed it for the car but it can be scaled up for home use
So much more is needed for life to become multiplanetary
Ive been driving with the yoke for a while its great imo Progressive steering would require complex gearing or drivebywire without direct mechanical link Will aim for that in a few years

I think about that quite a lot
Bring back the Zune Its time
For the Bitcurious Very well then lets do it
The comments in this thread are solid gold
Sometimes people think it is performance but safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla
It will be like this but bigger
One of my favorites quotes from a great human
Good chart This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from 1100km orbit to 550km Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years so space junk cannot accumulate
Schedule driver there is regulatory approval Has to be certified for each aircraft type Focusing on A320 as those serve most number of people with development testing on Gulfstream
Nothing wrong with healthy competition but this seems a little overthetop Would be cool if spacecraft could travel from one space station to another which is much harder than it seems
At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable Going public sooner than that would be very painful Will do my best to give longterm Tesla shareholders preference
Cool but an unnecessary complication for now These are being removed to speed up time to orbital launch
Actually a great many parts are produced by our suppliers but Tesla is more vertically integrated than other carmakers
Were almost done with first prototype booster This will go to test stand A Next one will fly to orbit Team has been crushing it many days nights in a row

Your company said the exact opposite in when it got a solesource uncompeted 11B DoD launch contract In any event expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter
Yes Longterm all settings will be in your Tesla app car will auto adjust
Then why were taxpayers forced to overpay for ULA
What is not well understood is that ULA still has a monopoly carveout for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should This is obviously not real competition
Now this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts everyone knows it However in this case it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary which is the goal of SpaceX vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed Boeing Not ok
ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement If this is not true then you wont have a problem removing it Your parent company Lockheed darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F was single source Seems a little inconsistent
Doubling diameter increases mass 4X but difficulty of simultaneously building launching rocket of that size is 4X In retrospect 9m diameter for Starship might have been wise Current size is ton stack mass tonF thrust which is more than double Saturn V
Of course you cant take that literally he meant the whole dairy industry
Yeah had great Poutine in Montreal Does feel like your life expectancy is dropping in realtime as you eat it but awesome nonetheless
Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry tons of payload it is not clear that cost per ton to orbitmoonMars improves with a larger rocket Aircraft for example have moved away from A380 to which has tons of payload
Sure We can show them live Eerily realistic Maybe we should make a game
Yeah main story line is not that long Played at max difficulty no aim assist so didnt softball it Razor fight was insanely difficult
When we need strange training examples eg half a car on highway Tesla sim delivers Also accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer so we need more close call examples For safety tests Autopilot sees dummy far away Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers

Outer engine ring is fixed angle but can throttle
Regen using motor braking means brake pads almost never need to be replaced
Yes we can fly Starship around space chomp up debris with the moving fairing door
Absolutely Staggeringly insane amount of work between now then
We could stretch the Falcon Heavy upper stage increase this a lot but FH already covers all known payloads Starship especially with orbital refilling dedicated deep space variants no heatshield flaps or header tanks will take this up orders of magnitude
Accurate Show that Falcon Heavy addresses all use cases
Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension as with ship Engines extend about 3m below booster
Working with Weddle Sons Roofing has been a great collaboration for accelerating Tesla Solar Roof installation This is a lot of work as tens of millions of homes need solar roofs If you are a roofing company please consider adding Solar Roof to your offerings
Yeah that would be cool Also using ship itself as structure for new giant telescope thats 10X Hubble resolution Was talking to Saul Perlmutter whos awesome he suggested wanting to do that
Looking good at sec Continued improvement will get it over
All Raptors on booster whether fixed or gimbaling would be the same gets tons of thrust TW of
Current plan is to increase base Raptor thrust to tons or million lbs increase booster engine count to or
LD makes quite a big difference We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield Dragon prefers high peak low total heat load as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes
Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines This is basically Raptor Raptor Vacuum would be only variant Tbd as to whether to commonize RVac with Raptor more thrust keep same or tighten throat more Isp Adding more RVac to ship with max Isp maybe

Review of Model S Plaid by Dan Neil wsjcom Tesla Model S Plaid Feel the Force in Seconds Though largely unchanged on the outside the new Model S is a technical tour de force the fastest hardestaccelerating most aeroefficient production sedan ever Dan Neil takes a road trip

Fred Astaire is incredible Worth watching his movies One of a kind
To be frank there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop because it is so unlike anything else I dont care I love it so much even if dont Other trucks look like copies of the same thing but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future
Improving permit approval speed lowering permit costs for solar would make a big difference
Lil X is hodling his Doge like a champ Literally never said the word sell even once
All your basis points are belong to us fiat issuers
Not bad although new Model S has more range faster charging Y should use long range version as Performance version is meant for max speed handling not max range Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW so that will help too
Glad its working The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering production launch teams is amazing Ping should improve dramatically in coming months Were aiming for 20ms Basically you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink

How about a wifi camera link
Wide beta maybe with FSD rev definitely with rev
Yeah I wuz running on almost no sleep
Theres a corner case where brick density is same density as water reaching bottom due to momentum
Current Summon is sometimes useful but mostly just a fun trick Once we move summon plus highway driving to a single FSD stack it will be sublime
FSD beta is using the pure vision production code for highway driving Beta hopefully Beta definitely will use one stack to rule them all city streets highway complex parking lots
Version of the SpaceX droneship Team did great work Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship
If we can do this successfully then anything developed for groundundersea fiber is automatically better in orbit
Some of these design trades are still open but will be resolved soon
Some traffic could just go terminal satellite satellite terminal never touch the regular Internet
Laser links in orbit can reduce longdistance latency by as much as due to higher speed of light in vacuum shorter path than undersea fiber
Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full parking lot Just like a car parking lot where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full
More ground stations less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences Looking at speed of light as 300km per millisecond satellite altitude of 550km average photon roundtrip time is only 10ms so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping 20ms
Similar to fiber optic We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function but modified for use in vacuum
Indeed but again like a parking lot a battery having big roads tends to decrease number of parking spaces ie stores less energy
Full test duration firing of Raptors on Super Heavy Booster
Seriously negative nominal interest rates What is the world coming to
You dont even need to touch the shifter in new S Auto detect direction will come as an optional setting to all cars with FSD
We created our own connector as there was no standard back then Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars Its one fairly slim connector for both low high power charging That said were making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year
Ironic indeed as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles But lithiumion has it covered Even with no advances in lithiumion technology its possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy
Also lasts much longer than normal roofs is able to withstand hail other mediumsized impacts
Flight tests showed that we could make body flaps narrower lighter
But much more important is that this design is capable of full rapid reusability Long way to go from design to making it actually fully rapidly reusable with high payload but at least success is one of the possible outcomes haha
Depending on progress with Booster we might try a engine firing on Booster

Computers are absurdly more accurate than humans How long would it take for a human to render even one frame of a modern video game at low res The computer will do high res at frames per second Not a contest
Seriously were getting eaten alive Cant get to Mars if the bugs eat us first
Tesla software team is excellent even when compared to the best software companies This is a big deal as cars are very much computers on wheels
Great work by Tesla Giga Berlin team supporting contractors
And thats just for Earth Mars has zero human population We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization
Ships are probably fine with iron cells but aircraft need very high energy density for good range Im not saying Tesla will do aircraft we have our hands full with cars solarbattery power generation just that max energy density is needed for aircraft
We will try Preferable for Tesla too as they last so long Unlike other makers of cars our goal is not to profit from service Best service is not needing service in the first place
Cars today are far more complex than Model T with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk Like Model T supply chain for battery EVs simply doesnt exist at massive scale so must be built in parallel Ideas are easy production is hard
Tesla Giga Shanghai team has done amazing work
Construction starts soon on a much larger high bay just north of current high bay
I was at Giga Texas yesterday Team is making excellent progress Building will be almost a mile long when complete
Quaternions are important for orbital spaceflight
Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge Even so fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars There are over combustion engine car fires every year in US alone Its literally in the name
Thats a low bar Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly although VW is trying to change that I personally wrote software for years have huge respect for software engineers Tesla is on par with best software companies is leader in real world AI

The comments on this article are funny
Austin now but back at Starbase tomorrow
Length will grow by ft over time
I am already chewing on so much glass that I have chipmunk cheeks
The building is stores tall so each floor is double size Hard to appreciate unless youre close
Good idea They are not easy to move over roads which is why the factory is close to the launch site but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport
Hadnt showered in several days We are going hardcore with Starbase Surge
I dont want to be CEO of anything
Tesla policy is never to give in to false claims even if we would lose never to fight true claims even if we would win
Actually I like use Apple products They are just obviously overcharging with App Store I mean fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable Epic wouldnt bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair
Only thing beyond ludicrous is Plaid
The Tesla AI predictions are swiftly becoming superhuman its guesses for what it cant see well feel like ESP It has a vastly larger training set than any human thinks only about driving
This should be clear to anyone who has experienced the FSD beta evolution Selfdriving requires solving a major part of realworld AI so its an insanely hard problem but Tesla is getting it done AI Day will be great
It really is all about the journey
We are doing releases every weeks on Friday at midnight California time
Needs to be level match booster fittings We will find out on Tuesday
There is always a lot of cleanup after a major code release Beta will be tight Still some fundamentals to solve for Beta but now that were pure vision progress is much faster Radar was holding us back
Indeed Both Cook I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated I tried to speak to him he declined Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone Cook is all things considered obviously doing an incredible job
Higgins managed to make his book both false and boring
Normally competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees but Apple Android have a duopoly on phones When interface familiarity is taken into account its basically a monopoly The effective sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry
Cook I have never spoken or written to each other ever There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever He refused to meet Tesla was worth about of todays value
He does like to play with my phone There are many confusing videos he has taken
Stage Zero which is everything needed to launch catch the rocket is at least as hard as the booster or ship
Reason we hustled so much to get Autopilot V1 out was that someone driving nonAutopilot Tesla fell asleep crashed killed cyclist Tesla driver was uninjured Driver nonetheless sued us saying new car smell made him fall asleep sigh Judge didnt agree
It is pitch black You are likely to be eaten by a grue
Thats arguably a security issue but allowing companies to use other payment options especially for inapp purchases would be fair As soon as they allowed that they would have to lower their fees As for the cost of reviewing apps for security a fixed fee makes sense
Will post once we have a decent simulation Our first design will probably be far from the bullseye
Replacement rate is so roughly generations but lets try to avoid this
PC desktop with latest graphics card although I have a Mac too Gigabyte laptop
Indeed Grid fin designs clearly work but do they maximize payload Good chance that they do not Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity so reduce landing propellant might have better performance Not sure Potential future optimization
Moving rocket to orbital launch pad
Aiming to stack ship on booster today
That is the goal Our official name is actually Space Exploration Technologies SpaceX is short form
It would be an honor to have you visit Starbase
I do love NASA always have
That was fun I was operating on limited sleep serious back pain so not at my best Its awesome that you know so much about how rockets work their development history Am happy to do another factory tour in a month or two talk about whats changed since last time
It will be exciting to see what new cultures humanity creates on other heavenly bodies
significant items Final heat shield tiles for ship Thermal protection of booster engines Ground propellant storage tanks QD arm for ship weeks
Total coincidence Also booster height was originally 70m but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency so now its
Once Mechazilla is operational winds will rarely be an issue
Just want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen despite extreme pressure to do otherwise Therein lies the core goodness of the American state
Hes shadowed me for several days so far
Yeah theyre all good but I particularly liked his biography of Ben Franklin
Tesla Automation Deutschland built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension If too low it would come loose at low temp due to CTE differences If too high it would snap at high temp rpm
Over time we might get orbital payload up to tons with full reusabity If Starship then launched as an expendable payload would be tons What isnt obvious from this chart is that StarshipSuper Heavy is much denser than Saturn V
I thought we had lost for sure We were just a tiny company back then only of launches got to orbit I had no money left Out of the blue a few days before Christmas NASA calls to say we won
I do think that great design engineering of products are critical but manufacturing supply chain require orders of magnitude more work
There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built its an insanely hard problem Moreover it must be rapidly completely reusable like an airplane This is the only way to make life multiplanetary Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large
Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse plus Booster Grid fins for aero control Boostback landing propellant tanks Protecting engines from entry loads Ship Body flaps for aero control Deorbit landing propellant tanks Heat shield
Due to its size ability to return science instruments even from deep space Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions
SpaceX could do it if need be
Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of unique parts in a car
What really matters for the longevity of civilization is making life multiplanetary on a sustained basis
Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen
flights is extremely unlikely Starship payload to orbit is tons so max of to fill ton tanks of lunar Starship Without flaps heat shield Starship is much lighter Lunar landing legs dont add much gravity May only need full ie tanker flights
Id recommend they get their first plant working Its insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost
However even if it were flights with docking this is not a problem SpaceX did more than orbital flights in first half of has docked with Station much harder than docking with our own ship over times
Always loved those Empire State photos with people eating lunch out on the beam

Twitter DM laughing emoji is nightmare
Shower thoughts work best for me
Solarwind batteries electric cars is obviously the future
Starship will enable humanity to become a multiplanet species
Pretty close Booster arms will move faster QD arm will steady booster for ship mate

In the end its all about entropy
No amount of money can defy physics
First orbital stack of Starship should be ready for flight in a few weeks pending only regulatory approval
And ship will be caught by Mechazilla too As with booster no landing legs Those are only needed for moon Mars until there is local infrastructure
As Jeffrey Besos is amply demonstrating
Some unexpected last minute issues Should go out in next day or two
Actual volume manufacturing where cash in cash out is so damn hard most people have no idea
probably then maybe Significant architecture changes in
Sorry its been pretty intense lately
Yes on both counts That would be a great outcome for civilization
Starship will be crushingly costeffective for Earth orbit or moon missions as soon as its operational rapid reuse is happening Mars is a lot harder because Earth Mars only align every months so ship reuse is limited to dozen times over to year life of ship
All models do make use of aluminum casting but new Y will be most advanced with of body cast
Beta or maybe Going to pure vision set us back initially Vision plus coarse radar had us trapped in a local maximum like a level cap Pure vision requires fairly advanced realworld AI but thats how our whole road system is designed to work NNs with vision
On now Tesla Aug Tesla AI Day presentation streaming live from at 5pm Pacific today
Do they even know about the delta variant
You can make anything fly haha
Its a quintillion floating point operations per second enough to simulate a human brain
Low center of mass Bit like our ship booster on reentry
We have almost all the pieces needed for humanoid robots since we already make robots with wheels
Btw theres a slight error with forward flap design Moving section is needed for control but passive section is counterproductive as it pushes nose backwards New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward further forward to improve moment arm Maybe deg apart
Probably slightly further forward smaller more inward No funny looking static aero at top as static aero no longer directly in flow
Bot is not directly on the path of accelerating a sustainable energy future but it aspirationally improves the probability that the future is good
No bottom static aero pushes engine section back counteracting Starships low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section Aiming for to deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight Dont want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma

This is a risk but not yet a limiting factor
Cant wait for new high bay
We should be there with Beta which goes out a week from Friday no point release this week It will have a completely retrained NN so will need another few weeks after that for tuning bug fixes Best guess is public beta button in weeks
My son asked if we would still speak English years from now I said probably not There was not even the faintest hint of English years ago
Just drove FSD Beta from Pasadena to LAX Much improved
Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel iron Id personally slightly opt for iron pack as it wants to be charged to whereas nickel prefers
In general we overfit to SF Bay Area
Its basically the plot of Fallout New Vegas
FSD Beta is actually not great imo but AutopilotAI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible Were trying to have a single stack for both highway city streets but it requires massive NN retraining
There is a profound difference between singleplanet multiplanet species If we are able to visit other stars one day we may discover many longdead singleplanet civilizations
No worries situation is under control
I thought was peak insanity but is more insane
Dont want to be unreasonable but maybe they should be required to deliver at least one vehicle per billion dollars of valuation before the IPO
Good to see you at Starbase

FSD Beta rolls out midnight Friday next week
Filing legal actions against SpaceX is actually his fulltime job
Looks promising that Beta about weeks later will be good enough for public opt in request button
They can shake their fist at the sky
He should consider spending some money on actual lunar lander hardware instead of shady lobbyists
A lot has happened in the past years
And Beta is a step change improvement from what you have
Good progress Applying information theory to currency which is just information lower fees reduce noise faster more consistent sync time improve latency jitter
In general I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people and when doing so should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness That said I would prefer to stay out of politics
Ur welcome pls be nice to the humans
The robots are coming anyway as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe but I can try my best to do so at Tesla
Maybe zap him on the head with our space lasers
Generally agree but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells Tesla strongly recommends against their use
That is the aspiration but we need to be cautious Safety is always paramount at Tesla
has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages so it wouldnt matter if we had new products as none would ship Assuming is not mega drama new Roadster should ship in
I mostly run alpha software in my car which is not meant for public consumption A few days before release I switch my car to what public will experience
Not sure but maybe a few months In general for any region we need to make software work well test it extensively then get regulatory approval If we could go faster while being safe we would
Our satellites launching in next few months have intersatellite laser links so no local downlink needed Probably active in to months
Processing is not an issue Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints so data can go from say Sydney to London through space which is faster speed of light than fiber shorter path Also no need for ground stations everywhere Arctic will have great bandwidth
I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit Its gonna be great But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production Production is super hard work which is why I have great respect for those who do it
Iron the last element made in a star appears likely to exceed nickel by or more
Yes Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high so harder to prevent hotspots Then pressure heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning Pretty basic
Technically data packets do not need to touch regular Internet data can flow from user terminal to satellites to user terminal
There are vast amounts of iron lithium on Earth but much less nickel For global industry to scale battery production to TWhyear it needs to be mostly iron Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles aircraft

FSD predicts height from video pixels directly without needing to classify groups of pixels into objects In principle even if a UFO crashed on the road right in front of you it would still avoid the debris Some work still needed to tune sensitivity
To be fair investors are giving us significant credit for achieving selfdriving given that Teslas valuationproduction is very high compared to other automakers
Think of Beta as enabling a significantly higher local maximum than Beta
It is hard to overstate criticality of reusable rockets No less important than reusable aircraft cars or bicycles Essential for humanity to become a multiplanet species backup the biosphere
Forward flaps will change a lot in upcoming versions of Starship smaller more leeward
Also we need to figure out how to render voxel height of unknown objects in a way that isnt horrendous

Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location
To be precise completely immediately reusable orbital rockets are the fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary
The lesson from tortoise hare is not that tortoises are faster but rather that hares should not be complacent

Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator If driving behavior is good for days beta access will be granted
Which games did they like most
Ironically yes at this time FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isnt necessary but it is Also any beta user who isnt super careful will get booted beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents Needs to stay that way
So few products that you truly love
Automatically drive to most obvious location unless occupant says otherwise
Some amount of cooperation would be good
Still basically nothing compared to the orbital mass flux needed for a base on moon or Mars
Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build but wont work with FSD Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though
Technology probably ready in a few months thereafter limited by regulatory approval
This engine needs to be 10X lower cost Order of magnitude change is good reason for a new name What really matters is not yet another advanced rocket engine as there are many such devices but there has never been a cheap Tonforce rocket engine Not even close

Tesla insurance calculator will show status in realtime tell you what actions are needed to be rated good driver
Fully reusable rockets want high TW to minimize ton to orbit because propellant cost actually matters
Long chain hydrocarbons like kerosene have excellent volumetric energy density but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen which is CH4 Also easy to make store CH4O2 from CO2H2O which are abundant on Mars

Its a big deal that Dragon is reusable with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made
Definitely further refinements coming to early beta safety test score It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability Exciting actuarial problem
Should be nationwide rollout by end of month Note still limited by peak number of users in same area This will improve as more satellites are launched
Long list of mostly little items but driving experience is significantly better We will put notable changes in the release notes
Note quality of experience can vary dramatically as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions

Full rapid reusability is the holy grail of orbital rocketry
Objectively her track record is extremely biased against Tesla
As soon as major construction is done so maybe in a few months
We can do that partially but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry same tech as nuclear missiles so there are more limitations than at Tesla

Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in Fix in work probably releasing tomorrow
Seeing some issues with so rolling back to temporarily Please note this is to be expected with beta software It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA hence public beta
Id like to express appreciation to Tesla Autopilot engineering QA for working round the clock all weekend to resolve the problem
Shaking out the problems literally haha
Neither Jared nor me nor anyone I know has anything to do with this foundation
Got to bar before RUD but cause may be due to oxygen inlet pressure too low rather than engine issues

Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD Our internal QA fleet didnt see this because cars are constantly in use so very rarely enter power saving mode Internal QA will obv test this case going forward
Raptor has a larger throat diameter so thrust is tons at bar
Possibly Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth high latency If both continue to improve substantially we will reach a point when no second layer is needed

That math is incorrect but still a lot of devices per second I guess if Tesla can reach 20M carsyear that would be one every seconds
FSDAI team is doing great work Will get superhuman good in upcoming releases Note we will slow down upload rate of releases going forward First from QA fleet to employee cars for a day then slowly releasing at carshr to external beta on Friday aft
Reducing traffic fatalities by seems likely perhaps ultimately by over
Also Tesla will soon be a German car manufacturer
Thanks for your support over the year
Indeed US taxpayers actually profited from the Tesla loan
German car manufacturers will rebound strongly They possess great talent which will not sit idle
Tentative plan is above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week If we see any concerns uploads will pause while we investigate so might take a few days before everyone with safety gets beta improves left turns across fast traffic stopping for gates

Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false I wish I had never met him Eberhard is by far the worst person Ive ever worked with in my entire career Given how many people Ive worked with over the years thats really saying something
He came damn close to killing Tesla through a combination of bad management decisions driving out talented people bad engineering major blunders in supply chain an elaborate deception about the true cost schedule of the Tesla Roadster
Interestingly however average power density of the sun is comparable to a compost heap humans are more power dense than the sun it is just very very big
Hoping to start releasing to scores with V10 in about days
Once the board was presented with the evidence of Eberhards deceptionfraud the dire state of the company all board members including those he appointed voted unanimously to fire him in August
Intersatellite laser communications means Starlink can carry data at speed of light in vacuum all around Earth before touching ground Over time some amount of communication can simply be from one user terminal to another without touching the Internet

Tragically it is not clear that the defense contractors can get to the moon for any amount of money More than 200B has been spent on development of new US crewed space transport systems over past years but only Dragon is flying Development cost to NASA was 2B
There were no EV incentives nor did we expect them gasoline was super cheap so tough to make the case for electric cars My guess was that we had chance of success most people thought The history car startups is just one big graveyard

In theory it saves landing leg mass enables immediate reflight of an otherwise unwieldy giant rocket
bbccom Jawdropping world fertility rate crash expected BBC News Nearly every country will see their populations fall as the world has fewer babies
nprorg US Birthrate Fell By In Hitting Another Record Low For the sixth year in a row the number of US births fell in reaching the lowest level since The fertility rate remains below replacement the level needed to compensate for deaths

Could people from Tonga let us know if it is important for SpaceX to send over Starlink terminals
People do not yet understand how valuable an autonomous vehicle will be
Baby X is just like this haha
Last year Japan had births life expectancy is years impressively high implying future population of only 68M dropping almost half from current population of 126M Thats a lot of ghost towns cities
Will do our best Decentralized control of the robots will be critical
But is he playing it on Legendary difficulty
I was just there Good progress
Its true I do think a lot about rocket engine chamber pressure ahaha
This is a hard thing for us to do right now as we dont have enough satellites with laser links there are already geo sats that serve the Tonga region That is why Im asking for clear confirmation
I hear versions of this often irl
Yeah this saves a whole tap Just swipe down for auto navigate
asahicom Estimated births in drop to level predicted for The Asahi Shimbun Breaking News Japan The number of babies born in Japan in is estimated to have declined to around a figure not expected until in the shrinking country according to calculations by The Asahi Shimbun
If you scare people enough they will demand removal of freedom This is the path to tyranny
Seems odd that the UN still hasnt released world death rates

Biden is treating the American public like fools
I am in awe of Sweden
Its like he could see the future
They appear to have some room for improvement
You should be voted out of office
Excited for future of solar at Tesla
It has been a very long road
Given how hard insanely FSD is I think it may take years or more before any company besides Tesla solves it
Theyre being driven around in limousines so they cant grok it
Tesla will support FSD licensing by other manufacturers
I have a feeling that the gerrymandering will not work as well as they think
There will only be EVs in the future
I have trouble understanding any other motivations tbh
Sounds about right for autonomous cars Optimus will greatly exceed this The economy will be as big as people want it to be There will be no scarcity except that which is artificially created
Your policies are directly responsible for the outrageously high insurance premiums paid by Californians
I might have made it too pointy
Our biggest limitation with Fremont is convincing enough associates to build cars when they have so many other job opportunities in the Bay Area Thanks again Tesla team for doing the hard work of building real products that people love
Honestly I would let the border regions vote Let the people there actually decide
This is a matter of much internal debate
Just that manganese is an alternative to iron phosphorus for scaling cathode production to several TWhyear
Manganese also requires less lithium as it operates at higher voltage

Im driving this program personally as is the case for almost all new programs
Now that the big automotive advertisers are making EVs you will see far fewer articles about EVs catching on fire It is not surprising that internal combustion engine cars have a tendency to combust externally too
The ratio of machine to human compute skyrockets
Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company both in car in factory This is not widely understood
Dave I know youre a fan but this is a silly question I dont drive programs because I want to but because I have to
Theyve been writing bogus articles about Tesla me for years In the end it is their own credibility that suffers
Harbinger battle on L is tough
Tesla has great respect for software engineering they do not
Thanks for the deep belly laugh
Hes actually a lobbyist not a journalist There are many who pose as the latter while behaving like the former No integrity Indeed there were no safety issues The car simply slowed to mph continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians
Thanks for letting me know Will be fixed soon
High latitudes are operational probably this summer
A step in the right direction
Will begin limited rollout to Canada this month Safety is paramount so we have to confirm no significant issues given slightly different road rules
Always look on the bright side of life
Why is the traditional media such a relentless hatestream Real question
Congrats SpaceX Falcon team Eric Berger Feb The Falcon rocket has now flown more consecutive successful missions than any orbital rocket in history
Tesla Model S X Plaid are so fun Tesla Silicon Valley Club Feb The Tesla Plaid Model X launch brings pure joy to each person that experiences it created the most enjoyable cars ever Show this thread
Who controls the memes Controls the universe
If things go well Falcon will launch about once a week on average in delivering of all Earth payload to orbit
A bigger win than it may seem
Thursday next week at 8pm Texas time
Thats true to some degree but citizen podcasts that arent negative like Rogan Fridman Dodd TED interviews etc are very popular Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard They so rarely even try to be positive
All these different standards for electricity are a tax on humanity
The Boring Company just connected Resorts World hotel to Vegas Convention Center
So hard to find out whats going on in the world without being bombarded with news that makes one sad angry
It was so crazy The insane tweet FUD campaign press hatestream of is still easily found
True careless negativity destruction is much harder than thoughtful positivity creation
Tesla is working hard to provide more Megapacks for grid stabilization
And all the forms of life on Earth
Starship aspires to be the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle the holy grail of rocketry This is the critical breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary
Becoming multiplanetary is essential to extending dramatically the probable lifespan of civilization
Starship is in a different league Orders of magnitude more mass to orbit than Falcon Necessary for creating a selfsustaining city on Mars
Only very high resolution radar is relevant
As backdrops go this is a good one
We have to solve a huge part of AI just to make cars drive themselves In retrospect it was inevitable The road system is designed for cameras eyes neural nets brains
Gavin is kinda badass in this vid
The duty of a leader is to serve their people not for the people to serve them
Tower arms are lifting Starship onto Super Heavy Booster

That was a tough one New Model Y structural pack is nextlevel though
Car should also reverse slightly if it peeks into an intersection sees fastmoving crosstraffic just like a person would
This would generate a lot of goodwill
Later this year remaining fussy bits will be gone allowing deletion of shroud
We dropped the ball badly regarding new Model X production ramp still havent fully recovered Was idiotic to stop production of old X in Dec when there was still plenty of demand

An evolutionary asymmetry helpful to survival but counterproductive when survival is not at stake
Now Tesla is worth a trilly willy
Wow thats a lot of podcasts Ok I will do one Maybe we could combine with Dave Lee a few
Agreed This has been broken for a long time
Yup we need to do that
Moving to engines on next booster
For an indepth explanation read enmwikipediaorg The Wages of Destruction Wikipedia
The fun police made us do it sigh
The pledge is good no matter what
Yes but more ground stations improved packet routing will make a bigger difference
So many layers with Tesla FSD AI

Entertainment is becoming a usernamepassword2FA nightmare
Will visit IRS next time Im in DC just to say hi since I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year Maybe I can have a cookie or something
M Night should do a horror movie about this it would resonate
This is just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion Stay tuned
Yes This is an advantage of iron cathode lithium batteries
Switching to renewables with batteries would avoid blackouts Batteries are essential due to the intermittent nature of renewables
If South Padre andor Brownsville would like a Starship prototype we can send one over
Sometimes small changes in a single week
Tesla owners in the greater Giga Texas area will get priority so yes
The only reason I didnt pay federal tax in is because I overpaid in Since they stole my tax records they actually know that
Im pretty sure Ive paid the most taxes of any individual ever to California but it isnt obvious what is done with the money
Small changes usually affect production for less than an hour as theyre applied to a few stations during breaks Big changes may impact output for a day or two Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days
We must fight for it to be better
Maybe near BRO airport since that serves both communities
Rather than correcting itself the lower birth rate trend appears to be accelerating
Sounds good we will send one over
It is taking longer than expected to make the upper stage not expendable sigh
Single biggest threat to future of civilization imo
Were working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles Former is obviously where we should be longterm
Instead of research suggests I suggest warlocks say
Building a case is exactly what Ive been doing
I didnt start the fight but I will finish it
Starlink service is now active in Ukraine More terminals en route
Hollywood refuses to write even one story about an actual company startup where the CEO isnt a dweeb andor evil
Im a fan of Rust Clearly scales well given that Discord uses it For max performance however nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer Otherwise we mostly use C Python
Signal is the least insecure messaging service
LIDAR is a seductive local maximum SpaceX designed built them to dock with ISS However the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets eyes so a general solution to selfdriving necessarily will require silicon neural nets cameras Realworld AI
Are you sure Signal is secure
Would be cool if we are backed up somehow
A general solution to selfdriving essentially realworld AI requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training inference control analytical tools data management hardware optimization simulation One of the hardest technology problems that exists
Compilers can be way better too Not enough effort spent there
While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the hard one in fact they are all difficult important Tight C custom compiler too An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency reliability long life is also critical Cant just jam GPUs in the trunk
Protagonists created over half a century ago dont count
Yeah definitely dont use C unless optimizing for hardware performance
Important warning Starlink is the only nonRussian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine so probability of being targeted is high Please use with caution
Tesla has created over US jobs building electric vehicles is investing more than double GM Ford combined fyi to person controlling this twitter
You will be in the future
Updating software to reduce peak power consumption so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter Mobile roaming enabled so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle
Ukraine civilian Internet was experiencing strange outages bad weather perhaps so SpaceX is helping fix it
Well I do have multiple personality disorder but theyre all technically in the same head
Our primary challenge is affordability Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla despite our much greater economies of scale better technology then it is damn near impossible for
Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection
That was me tweeting from when someone else had snatched my name I was actually one of the earliest Twitter users but dropped my account because people were tweeting such trivialities at first convinced me to get back in
Turn on Starlink only when needed place antenna away as far away from people as possible
Saudi Arabia owns of Lucid so inevitable
Actually we still operate our California factory which is the largest auto plant in North America at full capacity are considering expanding it significantly It has built of all electric vehicles in North America twice as much as all other carmakers combined
Yes provided no metal particles in paint
We couldve made a mile Model S months ago but that wouldve made the product worse imo as of time youd be carrying unneeded battery mass which makes acceleration handling efficiency worse Even our mile range car is more than almost anyone will use
Pretty good summary although national pride is underweighted relative to economics Latter serves former not other way around The foundational issue imo which this video doesnt ignore is low birth rate After all what good is land with no people
Coming soon if you want your car to make a loud farting sound from the external speaker just say Fart in their general direction
Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment so if we dont treat compensate our awesome people well they have many other offers will just leave Id like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience Tesla will do nothing to stop them
Solar area will need to be higher with obscuration but works better than one might think
In class action lawsuits the actual plaintiff is always the class action law firm They just find someone willing to serve as a puppet to represent the class
Almost all Viasat Ukraine user terminals were rendered permanently unusable by a Russian cyberattack on day of invasion so yes
Their negative gross margin will be staggering
Depends on what issues we see that are unique to Canada If things are looking good then we can lower the safety score threshold
